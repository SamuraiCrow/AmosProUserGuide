<h1>The Editor</h1>
<p>04.01 The Editor</p>
<p>04.02 Help</p>
<p style="page-break-before: always">Welcome to the AMOS Professional
Editor! It is assumed that you have either read the last Chapter, or
are already familiar with AMOS or Easy AMOS.</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>AMOS Professional provides one of the most effective and
	powerful creative environments for the Amiga programmer. It is also
	incredibly simple to use. Here is a synopsis of the AMOS
	Professional enhancements and improvements over the previous
	incarnations of the Editor.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The size of the Editor working area has been dramatically
	increased.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The increased working area is made possible by the
	provision of a comprehensive system of pull-down menus. The main
	menu headings are invisible until they are revealed by pressing the
	<b>right</b> mouse button. The second part of this Chapter provides
	a detailed guided tour of the vast selection of menu options.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The on-line Help system that was offered by Easy AMOS has
	been enhanced beyond recognition! Instant Help is available for any
	command, offering definitions, correct syntax and working examples.
	This allows instant insights into the hundreds of new commands
	provided by AMOS Professional for existing AMOS and Easy AMOS users.
	Chapter 4.2 contains a full analysis of the Help system.</p>
	<li/>
<p>A Monitor accessory can be called for analysis and reports
	of actual program listings, and this is explained in Chapter 12.1.</p>
	<li/>
<p>AMOS Professional features a split-screen Editor, allowing
	you to flick from program to program with a single mouse click.</p>
	<li/>
<p>There is immediate access to printer support, and listings
	can be printed by selecting a single menu option.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The block system has been dramatically improved, and given
	its own mode. Block Mode can be entered by double clicking on the
	<b>left</b> mouse button, or by summoning the [Block] menu.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The SET BUFFER command is now intelligent, allowing you to
	increase the memory area at any time, without the necessity to save
	programs first. Finally, the File Selector is new, improved and
	extremely friendly!</p>
</ul>
<p>The AMOS Professional Editor is very easy to use, and it may be
tempting to pick up the system as you go along, particularly if you
have experience of AMOS or Easy AMOS. After a few weeks of use, the
exploitation of the Editor features will become almost instinctive.</p>
<p><b>However</b>, if you plunge into the system without a little
guidance, you may well end up using only a fraction of the Editor's
potential capability. The sheer power of the system is vast, and it
would be a pity to overlook some of its exciting features. It is
possible that you may only need to refer to this Chapter once, but
please make sure that you are aware of everything that the AMOS
Professional Editor has to offer.</p>
<h2 class="western">The AMOS Professional Editor</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Editor is to make it as easy as possible to
create, adapt and modify AMOS Professional programs via your screen.
To achieve this, the Editor provides a range of tools that have been
designed with the sole purpose of saving Amiga programmers time,
trouble, frustration and confusion. It also short-circuits the need
for ugly, complex program listings! The Editor is intelligent, and will recognise AMOS Professional
instructions as they are typed in, allowing mistakes to be corrected
immediately.</p>
<p>You can even tidy up your program listings with an automatic
indenting option, and make them pleasing to the eye and more
accessible to the brain.</p>
<p>You are able to move through your streamlined listings at high
speed, jumping from one label or procedure to the next. The
procedures themselves are complete program modules that can be
compacted into a single line of your listing by “closing” them.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, the AMOS Professional Editor will call up Help
at the touch of a button, whenever you need it. 
</p>
<h2 class="western">The Edit Screen</h2>
<p>Here is a diagram of the AMOS Professional Edit Screen. There
follows a short guided tour of its features.</p>
<p><img src="images/402.gif" />
</p>
<h2 class="western">The Edit Icons</h2>
<p><img src="images/402direct.gif"/>
The
[&lt;D] button at the top-left of the screen is used to go into
Direct Mode. This is also achieved by pressing the [Esc] key. Direct
Mode is fully explored later.</p>
<p><img src="images/402wb.gif" />
The
[WB] button at the top-right of the screen is used to go to the
Workbench. If AMOS Professional has been loaded from the Workbench,
it will remain in memory, and you can return to AMOS Professional by
pressing [Left Amiga]+[A].</p>
<p>The [WB] button will have <b>no</b> effect if the CLOSE WORKBENCH
command has been called from one of your programs, as explained in
Chapter 13.1.</p>
<p>Between the [DIR] and [WB] buttons, there is a line of icons that
provide rapid access to various features, directly from the screen.
From left to right, they have the following uses:</p>
<p><img src="images/402run.gif"/>
As
usual, all of these icons are activated by the <b>left</b> mouse
button. This is the [RUN] button, and it is used to run the current
program listing. If any errors are encountered in the program, a
message will be displayed in the Information Line.</p>
<p><img src="images/402test.gif"/>
The
[TEST] button instructs AMOS Professional to test the current program
for errors, without running the program. A full list of error
messages is listed in Chapter 12.3, and the Help facility is
available to explain the correct use and syntax of instructions.</p>
<p><img src="images/402indent.gif"/>
[INDENT].
Use this button to automatically indent your program listings. Where
example programs are printed in this User Guide, they are displayed
in indented format.</p>
<p><img src="images/402monitor.gif"/>
This
icon is used to summon up the AMOS Professional [MONITOR], which
provides detailed help and analysis of your programs. A full
explanation of the Monitor can be found in Chapter 12.1.</p>
<p><img src="images/402help.gif"/>
[HELP].
The next Chapter provides a detailed examination of the AMOS
Professional help facilities. Use this button to call up the Help
main menu.</p>
<p><img src="images/402under.gif"> <img src="images/402above.gif"> [UNDER] and [ABOVE]. This pair of buttons is used to display the
window which is under or above the current window, in other words it moves to
the previous or next window.</p>
<p><img src="images/402ins.gif"> The [INSERT/OVERWRITE] button toggles between the two modes of
editing, which are explained in the paragraphs concerning the Information Line,
below.</p>
<p><img src="images/402procedueres.gif"> The [PROCEDURES] icon is used to open or close a procedure. Unlike
the image of the last button, which is a toggle, this icon is an animation, and after
being activated it returns to its original state.</p>
<p><img src="images/402return.gif"> This icon represents [INSERT A RETURN], and its use is dealt with
in the explanations of the menu options.</p>
<p><img src="images/402chipfast.gif"> The two indicator bars to the right of the above icon buttons
display the amount of <b>Chip</b> and <b>Fast</b> memory that is currently being used.</p>
<h2 class="Western">The Editor Window</h2>
<p>The windows that hold program listings appear immediately below
the row of Edit icons.</p>
<p>At the top of each window is an <b>Information Line</b>, that
displays the title of the current “project” and provides a status report. It also displays three <b>Edit Window
Icons</b>, as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/402close.gif"> At the left-hand side of the Information Line, there is a small
[CLOSE] icon. This closes the current window and erases its contents. Since this is a drastic action, you will be asked to confirm your
intentions before the window is closed. Select [Cancel] to abort the closing operation, and leave the
current program intact. Please note that when the <b>last</b> window is closed in this way, the program
will be erased and the window will be left clean, ready for your next editing action.</p>
<p>You may wish to open a new window now, before experimenting any
further. Please hold down the <b>right</b> mouse button and with the button held down, drag the
mouse pointer to the [Project] menu heading and highlight the [Open New] option. Now release the right
mouse button, and a new window will be opened at once. You can open more windows if you
wish, to prove how simple this is, and then close them again with the [CLOSE] button.</p>
<p>You are allowed as many active windows as you wish, providing that
there is enough screen space. Once a window has been opened, it may be re-positioned by dragging
its Information Line using the <b>left</b> mouse button, and its size can be changed by dragging
its lower border in the same way.</p>
<p>Only one window can be active at a time, and this is used for all
current editing operations, and menu selections. If there is more than one window open, an individual
window is selected by simply clicking on its contents with the mouse. A flashing cursor will be
positioned over the relevant programming line. The Information Lines of any inactive windows
are reduced to a dull display, leaving the current active window's display in its original bright
condition.</p>
<p>There are two other icons at the right-hand end of the Information
Line.</p>
<p><img src="images/402hide.gif"> The [HIDE] icon is used to hide a normal program from the display.
Hidden “accessory” programs are available directly from the [AMOS] main menu.
Accessories are discussed at the beginning of Chapter 13.1.</p>
<p><img src="images/402compress.gif"> This icon is the [COMPRESSOR] button, and it is used to compress a
window to a single title line, revealing and windows underneath. To expand a window to its
original state, simply click on this icon again.</p>
<h2 class="Western">The Information Line</h2>
<p>Between the window icons, the Information Line offers the
following status reports, from left to right.</p>
<p>The <b>number</b> of the window is displayed first, starting from
1.</p>
<p>The current Editing mode is displayed next. And it means that new
characters that are typed in will be <b>inserted</b> wherever the edit cursor is on the screen. This
is the default status. 0 indicates that new characters will overwrite characters that are already displayed in
the Edit Window.</p>
<p><b>L</b> and <b>C</b> indicate which <b>line</b> and which <b>column</b>
are currently being edited, in other words, the current location of the program cursor.</p>
<p><b>Free</b> indicates the amount of memory available to hold your listing. The
normal setting of approximately 32k can be increased at any time, via a simple menu
option.</p>
<p><b>Edit</b> lists the filename of the current program. If it is
not yet saved onto disc, it will be assigned the name “New project”.</p>
<h2 class="Western">The Scroll Bar</h2>
<p>To the right of the window area, there is a thin vertical bar.
This can be dragged with the mouse to move your window over the current program listing. The window may
also be scrolled vertically or horizontally by clicking anywhere along the edges of the display.
Moving through a long program listing is explained later, in the menu options and their
equivalent keyboard short-cuts.</p>
<p>If you click on the left mouse button and then hold down the <b>right</b>
mouse button, the slider will move rapidly through the listing, page by page. All AMOS Professional
sliders operate on a similar principle.</p>
<h2 class="Western">Direct Mode</h2>
<p>If you read through the last Chapter, you will be familiar with
the purpose of the AMOS Professional Direct Mode, otherwise it is assumed that you already have
experience of the AMOS or Easy AMOS Direct Mode operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The AMOS Professional Direct Mode has been completely redesigned
and vastly improved! Here is a synopsis of the major enhancements,</li>
<li>It is completely independent of the current program screen.</li>
<li>The size and position of the Direct Mode Window can be changed
instantly.</li>
<li>If necessary, all screen and graphics operations can be forced
onto the Direct Mode Window rather than the current program screen, using the new [OUTPUT]
facility.</li>
<li>[OUTPUT] also allows directory listings and the contents of
variables to be displayed via Direct Mode, without destroying an existing game or utility
screens.</li>
<li>The “history buffer” that stores lines already typed via
Direct mode is now accessed with the [up arrow] and [down arrow] keys, similar to the Shell program
from the Workbench. The contents of the history buffer is remembered when you leave Direct
Mode, ready to be called up when you return.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please enter Direct Mode, now either by clicking on the [DIR]
button in the Edit Window, or by pressing the [Esc] key.</p>
<p>The Direct Mode working screen will appear, looking like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/406directmode.gif"></p>
<p>The Direct Mode screen has a bar of useful icons above a large
window area where commands are entered and their results displayed.</p>
<p><img src="images/406editbutton.gif"> The [&lt;E] button at the top-left of the screen is used to return
to Edit Mode. This is also achieved by pressing the [Esc] key.</p>
<p><img src="images/402wb.gif"> The [WB] button at the top-right of the screen is used to go to
the Workbench. If AMOS Professional has been loaded from the Workbench, it will remain in
memory, and you can return to AMOS Professional by pressing [Amiga]+[A]. The [WB]
button will have no effect if the CLOSE WORKBENCH command has been called from one of your
programs, as explained in Chapter 13.1.</p>
<p><img src="images/406output.gif"> To the right of the “DIRECT” identification panel is the
[OUTPUT] icon. This is used to toggle the display of all operations between the Direct Mode
window and your program screen. If selected, operations will be performed in the Direct
Mode window, and the program display will remain untouched. To return to normal, simply
select the [OUTPUT] button again. Please note that only text output is permitted within this
window.</p>
<p>The row of ten icons between the [OUTPUT] and [WB] icons are the
equivalent of pressing one of the Direct Mode <b>function key pre-sets</b> [F1] to [F10]. Selecting
one of these icons with the left mouse button is the same as pressing the equivalent function key.
Selecting a button with the right mouse button is the equivalent of pressing [Shift]+[Function key].</p>
<p>Here is a list of the pre-set commands called by these icons.
Experienced AMOS programmers will already be familiar with their meanings, and new users will be
introduced to them in the following Chapters. The following function key assignments are for Direct
Mode only, and should not be confused with the operation of function keys from Edit Mode.</p>

<p>The Direct Mode window can be moved around the screen by dragging
it with the left mouse button, or by pressing the [Ctrl] + [Up Arrow] and [Ctrl] + [Down Arrow]
keys. The size of the Direct Mode window is changed by dragging its bottom border, or by using the
[Shift]+[Up Arrow] and [Shift]+[Down Arrow] keys.</p>
<p>You are reminded that the [Up Arrow] and [Down Arrow] keys are
also used to recall up to twenty previous lines entered in Direct Mode. Simply hit the [Return] key
to execute any recalled line. The number of lines that can be recalled may be changed from twenty to
anything in the range of zero to 128, and this process is explained in Chapter 13.1.</p>
<p>To end this examination of AMOS Professional Direct Mode, your
attention is drawn to the prompt line at the lower left of the Direct Mode Window. The AMOS Pro &gt;
prompt is highlighted, and marks the position at which your typed instructions will appear. The
prompt itself awaits your instructions, which will be executed as soon as you press the [Return] key.</p>
<h2 class="Western">The File Selector</h2>
<p>Please summon up the File Selector now. Simply go to Direct Mode
and press [F10] on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Programs are stored on discs as “files”, and each is given an
individual file name. The File Selector is a means to gain access to individual files, and Chapter 10.2 is
devoted to all the aspects of files stored on disc.</p>
<p>The AMOS Professional File Selector is faster than its AMOS and
Easy AMOS predecessors, it offers more features and it happens to be a lot better looking! The
physical size and positioning of the File Selector can be changed to your own preferences and this is
explained in Chapter 13.1. When the AMOS Professional File Selector is summoned, it appears like this:</p>
<img src="images/408fileselect.gif" />
<p>Please note that a maximum of 10k is needed to open the AMOS
Professional File Selector. If memory does not allow for the File Selector to be opened, a simple <b>input
line</b> will be displayed instead, inviting you to enter a file name. If this very rare situation
happens, type in the name of the file you wish to load or save, and press [Return].</p>
<p>The standard AMOS Professional File Selector features a window displaying the names of all the files stored 
on the current disc. There is a slider bar to the right of this window, as well as a pair of Up/Down arrows, 
allowing you to scroll through the file names. By
using this slider, all available paths can be displayed, without the need to specify path names.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the File Selector is a column of buttons offering the following facilities, from top to bottom:</p>
<p>[OK]</p>
<p>This affirmative button informs AMOS Professional that you are
satisfied with the current situation and dismisses the File Selector, returning you to the current
program. It can be used to save the current program to disc, after you have typed in the new program
name in the input line at the bottom of the File Selector. Whenever you click on [OK], AMOS
Professional automatically sets its current directory to the directory of the File Selector.</p>
<p>[Cancel]</p>
<p>Cancel your current operation by clicking on this button.</p>
<p>[Parent]</p>
<p>Because the hierarchy of individual files can get complex, it is
sometimes necessary to negotiate a path through the current directory. A full explanation of this
subject is covered in Chapter 10.2.</p>
<p>[Devices]</p>
<p>This is used to call up a list of all devices. In other words, the
available hardware items, such as disc drives.</p>
<p>[Assigns]</p>
<p>When this option is selected, only the current assigns are listed.</p>
<p>[Sort]</p>
<p>If this button is in the “on” position, files will be
automatically sorted when they are read from the disc, and listed in order. The File Selector will remember the
setting of the [Sort] button when it is next called.</p>
<p>[Sizes]</p>
<p>If this button is “on”, the size of each file will be
displayed. This setting is also remembered when the File Selector is subsequently called.</p>
<p>[Get Dir]</p>
<p>This button re-reads the current disc directory, and can be useful
if the floppy disc has been changed.</p>
<p>[Store]</p>
<p>The system works normally if this button is “off”, but as soon
as it is clicked “on”, the directory is stored in memory. If there is enough memory available, up to ten
different directories may be stored with this facility. The positions in the list are stored along
with the list of files themselves, so that next lime you request a directory, AMOS Professional will scan the list
of stored directories and attempt to match any requested path names. If successful, the directory is
displayed instantly, and if unsuccessful, a normal search of the disc will take place.</p>
<p>Below this column of buttons, there is a small slider display
indicating available memory. The small [X] button to the right of this slider is used to erase the
current directory from memory. Note that releasing the [Store] button will erase <b>all</b> stored
directories.</p>
<p>Please note that before available memory is exhausted, AMOS
Professional will automatically “flush” stored directories, freeing as much memory as possible.</p>
<ul><li>You can move the File Selector to another position on screen by
dragging the title bar with the left mouse button.</li>
<li>The [Up Arrow] and [Down Arrow] keys can be used to scroll through
the list of files.</li>
<li>The [Tab] key can be used to change the path or name of the edit
zone.</li>
<li>To summon a new directory, either use the [Get Dir] button or
press the [Enter] key.</li>
<li>If error messages are displayed in a small requester, they can be
dismissed by a mouse click or by pressing any key.</li>
<li>Because AMOS Professional stores directories in their most recent
state, you should use the [Get Dir] option to re-display a large directory that has not had
time to be fully displayed when it was stored.</li>
<li>The amount of RAM used by the File Selector depends on the size of
the screen and the number of files. File selector routines require 2k, and each file
requires its length plus ten bytes (so 100 files of 16 characters needs 3k.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="Western">Saving and loading a program</h2>
<p>Once you have created an AMOS Professional program, it can be
saved onto disc using the [Save] option from the [Project] menu, or by pressing [Amiga]+[S]. The
File Selector will appear, and you can enter your file name, them press [return] to save it onto the
disc.</p>
<p>Programs are loaded using the same system. Select the [Load]
option from the [Project] menu, or press [Amiga]+[L]. Alternatively, you can load a program into a
brand new window using the [Open &amp; Load] option, explained later. Choose the name of the
program to load by highlighting it in the File Selector window, then press [Return]. It's as simple as that.</p>
<p>If your current program is too large for the current Editor
window, a dialogue box will appear asking if you wish to adapt its size. Selecting the [Yes] option will
increase the memory to the <b>minimum</b> amount required for holding your program. To add extra lines will
prove impossible unless you make some deletions first. By pressing the [No] option, a SET TEXT
BUFFER operation will be called, setting the buffer area to the <b>exact</b> size required for the
current program. You can now increase the size of the buffer area as required.</p>
<h2 class="Western">Autosave and Autoresume</h2>
<p>As a default, you will be automatically prompted to save the
results of your current programming session every 30 minutes. A separate Autosave dialogue box will be
displayed for each window on screen. Pressing [Return] or clicking on the [Yes] button will
save your program to disc under its current file name automatically. If the program has not been
previously saved, the File Selector will be summoned inviting you to enter the new program name. The time
elapse between Autosaves can be changed to your own choice, using the configuration options
detailed later.</p>
<p>The [Quit options] item from the [Config] menu allows the
automatic saving of the current programming environment to disc, whenever you leave AMOS
Professional. This environment includes all current programs, along with a complete list of
currently open windows. Even the cursor positions are saved! This means that when you return to AMOS
Professional, your screen is exactly as it was, and you can re-commence your programming session at the
point from which it was left. This facility is intended for hard drive users, although it can be
exploited if you have an additional floppy disc drive, provided that you boot AMOS Professional directly, as
opposed to from the Workbench, and save your programs on the additional external floppy drive.
Your start-up disc should be write-enabled to allow AMOS Professional to load in this way.</p>
<h2 class="Western">The AMOS Professional Editor Menus</h2>
<p>The following section of this Chapter contains a comprehensive
explanation of every option available from the AMOS Professional Editor Menus. The menus are examined in
the order that they appear, from left to right, when the <b>right</b> mouse button is pressed
to reveal them. All menu headings, menu options and sub-menu items that can be selected via the mouse are
shown between square brackets. Where selections can also be made via the keyboard, the keys are
also shown in square brackets. A function key appears like this [F1], and a key in the numeric
keypad appears like this [N1]. For example:</p>
<p>[About AMOS Professional]</p>
<p>This indicates that the menu option is selected by highlighting it
with the mouse pointer, and then releasing the mouse button.</p>
<p>[Run] or [F1]</p>
<p>This means that the option can be chosen via the mouse, or it can
be summoned by pressing a single function key.</p>
<p>[Save As] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[S] In this case, the option may be
selected using the mouse, or by pressing the indicated combination of keys together. Main menu
headings are shown in large bold type, with their options printed in smaller bold type. Where an
option has its own sub-menu, the items in the sub-menu are shown in standard type, as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Config </td>
<td>Main menu heading</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>[Set Editor]</b></td>
<td>Menu option</td></tr>
<tr><td>[Setup]</td>
<td>Item in option sub-menu</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Here is the list of the AMOS Professional Editor Menu options.</p>
<h3 style="Western">AMOS</h3>
<p>The [AMOS] menu appears in the top left-hand corner of the screen,
and provides information and control of accessory programs via the following options:</p>
<p><b>[About AMOS Professional]</b></p>
<p>This displays a title box, and indicates the number of any
extension files that have been installed into AMOS Professional, such as the music extension or picture
compactor extension.</p>
<p><b>[About Loaded Extensions]</b></p>
<p>This option displays detailed information about all extensions
that are currently loaded. Each extension has its own title screen, and the list can be examined
via the [Prey] and [Next] buttons. Click on [Cancel] to return to the Editor Screen. You are free to
create your own extensions for use with the AMOS Professional system, and more information on this
topic can be found in Appendix D of this User Guide.</p>
<p><b>[Load Accessory]</b></p>
<p>When this option is selected, a file selector is opened, allowing
any AMOS Professional program to be loaded as an accessory. Unlike normal programs, accessories are
hidden away in memory, and do not need their own window in order to work. Accessories can be run by
selecting their name from this [AMOS] menu list, and if this is done, the following options are
presented:</p>
<p><b>[Run]</b></p>
<p>This runs the accessory immediately, without affecting the
existing programs.</p>
<p><b>[Edit]</b></p>
<p>Use the [Edit] option to copy the selected accessory into a new
window, allowing it to be edited directly on screen.</p>
<p><b>[New]</b></p>
<p>This erases the accessory from memory, and removes its reference
from the AMOS Professional menu.</p>
<p>Please note that the last three options may <b>not</b> be assigned
to a keyboard short-cut. If you want to install the program as a normal menu item, the [Set Program to
Menu] option should be used instead. Please refer to the [Config] main menu for details.</p>
<p><b>[New All Accessories]</b></p>
<p>This option is used to delete all accessories from memory. You
will be asked to confirm your action before the deletions are executed.</p>
<p><b>[Quit]</b></p>
<p>This quits AMOS Professional completely, and returns you directly
the Workbench or CLI.</p>
<p>A number of features are provided to save vital data to disc
automatically before you quit AMOS Professional, and these are explained near the end of this Chapter
in the [Config] Main menu section.</p>
<h4>Project</h3>
<p>This menu provides all of the options that are used to manipulate
program listings, and existing AMOS and Easy AMOS users will find some familiar commands here.</p>
<p><b>[Run]</b> or <b>[F1]</b></p>
<p>This runs the AMOS Professional program that is in the active
window.</p>
<p><b>[Test]</b> or <b>[F2]</b></p>
<p>This triggers a check through your program listing, searching for
any syntax errors. If a problem is encountered, a report is given on the screen.</p>
<p><b>[Indent]</b> or <b>[F3]</b></p>
<p>Use the automatic indentation system to make program listings
easier to read. Extra spaces are added at the beginning of all lines that belong to particular sorts of
routines, and similar indenting is shown throughout the example programs printed in this User Guide.</p>
<p><b>[Monitor]</b> or [<b>F4]</b></p>
<p>See how your programs run and operate under the AMOS Professional
Monitor. Chapter 12.1 explains all the monitor's operations in details.</p>
<p><b>[Open New]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[W]</b></p>
<p>This is used to open a completely new window on the editor screen.</p>
<p><b>[Open &amp; Load]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[L]</b></p>
<p>This is a fast method of loading a program directly into a new
window. After it opens the window, the program is loaded via a standard File Selector.</p>
<p><b>[Load]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[L]</b></p>
<p>This will load a program into the current window, and any existing
contents of this window will be completely erased. If the new program is larger than the available
editor buffer space, the following dialogue box appears on screen:</p>
<p>Text Buffer too small. Adapt size?</p>
<p>If you click on the [YES] response, the size of the buffer will be
set to the absolute minimum needed to hold the program, and it should only be used if you do not intend
to make any further changes, because the buffer will be filled to capacity.</p>
<p>By selecting [NO], the [Set Text Buffer] option will be called
from the [Editor] main menu, allowing you to expand the buffer to any required value.</p>
<p><b>[Save]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[S]</b></p>
<p>This option is used to save your AMOS Professional program to
disc. If there is no existing filename for the program, a request is made to enter a new name via a
standard File Selector. If the name already exists, the program will be copied into the original
file immediately.</p>
<p><b>[Save As]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[S]</b></p>
<p>This saves the existing program under a new name. A selector will
be displayed on screen to allow the destination file to be selected.</p>
<p><b>[Close]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[Q]</b></p>
<p>When this option is chosen, the active window is closed down and
its contents are completely erased. If the window has been set up using the split-screen option, the
<b>original</b> source listing will remain intact.</p>
<p><b>[New]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Q]</b></p>
<p>Using this option will delete the current program, leaving its
window in position, ready for further editing.</p>
<p><b>[Hide]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[H]</b></p>
<p>This closes the present screen window, and hides the program into
memory as an accessory. This program may now be called from the [AMOS] Main menu heading
directly.</p>
<p><b>[Hide]</b></p>
<p>Can only be used if there are at least two windows on the screen,
and the last window on display cannot be hidden. If a split screen is hidden, all splits are
erased and the window is then hidden.</p>
<p><b>[Print]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[P]</b></p>
<p>If there is an active printer connected to your Amiga, this option
can be used to list the current program directly onto paper.</p>
<p><b>[Merge]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[M]</b></p>
<p>With this option you can merge in from disc another file that was
previously saved as an normal AMOS Professional program. This allows you to merge in libraries
of routines when you need them.</p>
<p><b>[Merge ASCII]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[M]</b></p>
<p>This merges an ASCII text file into the current program listing.
For large listings, the merging-process can take a few minutes to complete, so patience may be needed.</p>
<p><b>[Check 1.3]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[I]</b></p>
<p>Calling all AMOS users of version 1.3! This option performs an
automatic test on your AMOS Professional programs to see if they are compatible with AMOS
v1.3. A search is made for any commands that are <b>not</b> available to AMOS v1.3, as well as
any memory banks with an index number above 16. A message will be generated informing you whether or not
your AMOS Professional program can run under AMOS v1.3.</p>
<p>The Editor will save the correct header automatically. If it is
compatible with AMOS v1.3, that header will be used, otherwise the AMOS Professional header will be
employed.</p>
<p><b>[Information]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[I]</b></p>
<p>This option calls up a useful information panel, where details of
the current programming session are summarised like this:</p>
<table>
<th colspan="2">AMOS Pro Editor Information</th>
<tr><td>Free Chip Ram:</td><td>(the amount of available memory for sound and graphics)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Free Fast Ram:</td><td>(available space for listings, menu banks and dialogue routines)</td></tr>
</table><table>
<th colspan="2">About current program</th>
<tr><td>Text Length:</td><td>(memory assigned to the editor window)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bank length:</td><td>(memory used by your banks)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of visible lines:</td><td>(the size of the program in lines)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of instructions:</td><td>(the total number of instructions in the program)</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Editor</h3>
<p>The [Editor] main menu heading provides the gateway to all of the
vital editing commands. It is divided into a set of sub-menus, each of which provides a group of
important related options.</p>
<p><b>[Procedures]</b></p>
<p>This displays a small sub-menu that contains all of the options
needed to fold and unfold procedure efinitions. The use of procedures is described in detail in
Chapter 5.5.</p>
<p>[Open/Close] or [F9]</p>
<p>This option is used to fold or unfold the single procedure which
is currently under the cursor. After this has been done, the <b>whole</b> program is checked for
errors, and if a problem is encountered, an appropriate message is displayed on screen, and the operation is
aborted. If all is well, a closed procedure will be opened to reveal all of its original contents,
or an open procedure will be folded away and be replaced by a single line containing nothing but the
procedure's name.</p>
<p>Closed procedures can be cut and pasted as usual, but they cannot
be deleted using the editor keys. To remove a folded procedure, the [Cut] option should be used.</p>
<p>[Open All] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[O]</p>
<p>Use this option to open all currently folded procedures,
displaying the current program in its original glory.</p>
<p>[Close All] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[C]</p>
<p>This folds all procedures into memory, leaving a single procedure
name line for each one.</p>
<p>[Insert Program]</p>
<p>This option is used to load a machine language routine directly
into the selected procedure. This procedure will now be closed and its existing contents will be
replaced by the new code. Please see Appendix A for full details.</p>
<p><b>[Windows]</b></p>
<p>The windows menu is used to set the size and position of editor
windows. Here is a list of the menu items:</p>
<p>[Previous] or [F6]</p>
<p>This moves the cursor up to the window above the currently active
window.</p>
<p>[Next] or [F7]</p>
<p>When this option is selected, the cursor is positioned over the
next window on the display.</p>
<p>[Flip Size] or [Amiga]+[N5]</p>
<p>This reduces the window to a single title line, keeping it
displayed and out of the way.</p>
<p>[Split] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[V]</p>
<p>When a new window is opened on the current program via this
option, it can be freely positioned anywhere in the listing. This allows several different sections of
the program to be displayed on screen simultaneously.</p>
<p>Please note that this option does not create a separate copy of
the program listing in memory, it simply splits a single listing between a number of different
windows. This means that any changes will be shown on all of the relevant windows as soon as they are
made.</p>
<p>The [Split Screen] option can be de-activated by the [Close]
command in the [Project] menu, explained earlier. It can also be turned off with the [Close Window] icon on
the window title.</p>
<p>The window title lines will change automatically to reflect the
new mode, with the “Edit” message to the left of the filename being replaced by “Split”.</p>
<p>[Link cursor] or [Amiga]+[C]</p>
<p>This links the movements of the text cursor between any two
windows. This means that whenever one of the selected windows is scrolled through, the other will
keep in step.</p>
<p>The source window is the window which is currently active, and a
request will be made to select the destination window as soon as [Link cursor] is selected. To select
one, move the mouse pointer over a window and click once on the <b>left</b> mouse button. The source
and destination windows are now linked together. To separate them, trigger [Link Cursor] again and
click on the source window.</p>
<p>This option is very useful for copying data from one program to
another, as well as for comparing two programs, line by line.</p>
<p>[Move up] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[N8]</p>
<p>[Move down] or [Amiga]+[Shift]+[N2]</p>
<p>These two options move the top of the current window up or down in
units of eight pixels, which is one screen line. It is also possible to position the window
directly, by dragging the mouse pointer on the window title with the left button.</p>
<p>[Expand] or [Amiga]+[N2]</p>
<p>This moves the bottom border of the window eight pixels downwards,
increasing its size by one screen line.</p>
<p>[Reduce] or [Amiga]+[N8]</p>
<p>To reduce the bottom border of the window, use this option to
position it higher by one screen</p>
<h3 style="Western">Macros</h3>
<p>The [Macros] menu allows a whole string of editor commands to be
assigned to a single key-press.</p>
<p>[Enter a New Macro] or [Ctrl]+[M]</p>
<p>After selecting this option, you will be asked which key-press is
to be allocated to the new Macro. This can be a single character or a combination of keys that are
to be pressed together. Macros work by referring to the “scan code” of keys rather than the actual
character value. This means that any key or combination of keys can be assigned independently, including
the keys from the numeric keypad, providing that the following rules are obeyed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other Macro definitions may not be included. They will be
completely ignored!</li>
<li>Each Macro definition can hold up to 400 key presses.</li>
<li>Menu short-cuts can only be used if they do not call up a dialogue
box, so the keys allocated to [Search New] are not available, but the [Search Next] and [Search
previous] keys will work without problems.</li>
<li>If your key combination has been previously assigned to a menu
item, the existing short-cut keys will be de-activated and the new Macro definition will take
priority.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a new Macro has been defined, click on a mouse button to save
it into memory. To keep Macro definitions, they can be saved directly onto disc using the [Save
Macro] option explained below.</p>
<p>[Delete One Macro]</p>
<p>Simply select the Macro to be deleted by pressing its key
combination. It will then be deleted from memory. This memory space will now be released to the main AMOS
Professional system.</p>
<p>[Delete All Macros]</p>
<p>This option is used to erase all Macro definitions in a single
operation.</p>
<p>[Load Macros]</p>
<p>This loads a named Macro file from disc.</p>
<p>[Load Default Macros]</p>
<p>Use this option to load the AMOSPro.Macros file from the APSystem
folder.</p>
<p>[Save Default Macros]</p>
<p>This saves all defined Macros into a special file on disc, named
AMOSPro.Macros. In future, whenever AMOS Professional is run, the saved Macros will be loaded
instantly.</p>
<p>If necessary, Macro definitions can be saved automatically,
whenever you leave AMOS Professional. This process is detailed below, under [Quit Options] in the
[Config] Main Menu heading.</p>
<p>[Save Macros]</p>
<p>When this option is called, a file selector is opened with a
request for a filename to be given. All Macro definitions will be saved in the chosen file onto disc. This
can be used to create special Macro lists for particular programming tasks.</p>
<p>While working on a very long program, a great deal of time can be
wasted moving back and forth through the listing. The next selection of menu options is used to
control up to ten markers, which allow a specific position in the listing to be marked and saved.</p>
<p><b>[System Marks]</b></p>
<p>The first, second and third Marks are automatically loaded with
your last three cursor positions, so if you move to a new label, or execute a [Search/Replace] operation,
for example, you can jump back to the previous location instantly.</p>
<p>The Mark system works like a stack, and every time you move to a
new location in the program listing, the position of the cursor in added at the bottom of the
stack, with the oldest Mark being discarded from the top of the stack. When the [System Mark] option
is chosen, the following simple sub-menu is presented:</p>
<p><b>[Goto 1] or [Ctrl]+[N1]</b></p>
<p><b>[Goto 2] or [Ctrl]+[N2]</b></p>
<p><b>[Goto 3] or [Ctrl]+[N3]</b></p>
<p>These three options are used to jump directly to the last, second
to last and third from last cursor positions.</p>
<p><b>[User Marks]</b></p>
<p>These marker points can be user-defined anywhere in the current
program. The Marks are set by holding down the [Ctrl]+[Shift] keys, and pressing a key from [4]
to [9].Once a Mark has been set in this way, it can be jumped to by holding down the [Ctrl] key and
pressing the appropriate number key.</p>
<p>The [User Marks] option presents two lists of Mark numbers from
[4] to [9]. By highlighting one of these items, an additional menu is presented allowing you to [Set]
or [Goto] the chosen Mark.</p>
<p><b>[Cursor Move]</b></p>
<p>This option is provided to show a representation of the movement
keys from within the menu. Once you have become familiar with the various key combinations, it is
probably faster to control movements directly from the keyboard. Here are the various items
in this menu:</p>
<p>[Goto Line Number] or [Amiga]+[G]</p>
<p>This is used to move the cursor directly to a specified line, and
a dialogue box is presented ready for the line number to be entered. The lines in the listing are
counted from the top, starting at line number one. Closed procedures are treated as a <b>single</b> line.
Press [Return] or click on the [OK] button to jump to the specified line.</p>
<p>[Previous Label] or [Alt]+[Up Arrow]</p>
<p>This is used to jump directly to the previous label or procedure
definition in the program listing.</p>
<p>[Next Label] or [Alt]+[Down Arrow]</p>
<p>Use this option to jump to the next label or procedure definition
in the listing.</p>
<p>[Text Top] or [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[Up Arrow]</p>
<p>This will display the program listing from the very first line.</p>
<p>[Page Up] or [Ctrl]+[Up Arrow]</p>
<p>Scroll the program listing up by one window page, using this
option.</p>
<p>[Page Top] or [Shift]+[Up Arrow]</p>
<p>This moves to the top of the current window.</p>
<p>[Page Bottom] or [Shift]+[Down Arrow]</p>
<p>Jumps directly to the bottom of the current window.</p>
<p>[Page Down] or [Ctrl]+[Down Arrow]</p>
<p>Scrolls the program listing down by a single window page.</p>
<p>[Text Bottom] or [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[Down Arrow]</p>
<p>Use this option to move directly to the last line in the program
listing.</p>
<p>[Line Start] or [Ctrl]+[Left Arrow]</p>
<p>Jump to the beginning of the current line in the listing.</p>
<p>[Word Left] or [Shift]+[Left Arrow]</p>
<p>This is used to move to the previous word in the program listing.</p>
<p>[Word Right] or [Shift]+[Right Arrow]</p>
<p>The cursor is placed over the next word in the program listing.</p>
<p>[Line End] or [Ctrl]+[Right Arrow]</p>
<p>This option moves the cursor to a position immediately after the
last character in the current line.</p>
<p><b>[Insert/Delete]</b></p>
<p>Here is a list of the options available for inserting and deleting
in program listings:</p>
<p>[Clear Line] or [Ctrl]+[Q]</p>
<p>This is used to delete the entire line in which the cursor is
currently positioned, leaving a blank line in its place.</p>
<p>[Delete to S.O.L.] or [Ctrl]+[Backspace]</p>
<p>This erases all characters from the current position of the cursor
backwards to the Start Of the current Line.</p>
<p>[Delete Left Word] or [Shift]+[Backspace]</p>
<p>The word to the immediate left of the cursor is deleted by this
option.</p>
<p>[Delete Right Word] or [Shift]+[Del]</p>
<p>This erases the word in the current line immediately to the right
of the cursor.</p>
<p>[Delete to E.O.L.] or [Ctrl]+[Del]</p>
<p>Use this option to erase all characters from the current cursor
position forwards to the End Of the current Line.</p>
<p>[Delete Line] or [Ctrl]+[Y]</p>
<p>This completely erases the current line, and the program listing
scrolls upwards one line to fill the gap.</p>
<p>[Insert Line] or [F10]</p>
<p>This option is used to insert a blank line at the present position
in the program listing.</p>
<p>[Tab Right] or [Tab]</p>
<p>Move the cursor right, to the next Tab setting.</p>
<p>[Tab Left] or [Shift]+[Tab]</p>
<p>This is used to move the cursor one position left to the previous
Tab setting.</p>
<p>[Set Tab] or [Ctrl]+[Tab]</p>
<p>This option is used to set the distance in characters between
successive Tab stops.</p>
<p><b>[Set Text Buffer]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[T]</b></p>
<p>This is the option which is used to change the size of the memory
area assigned for program listings. Each window has its own separate text buffer, which can be set
independently.</p>
<p>A dialogue box appears, allowing a new text buffer size to be
entered directly. If the memory allocation is increased, the new space can be used immediately
from the Editor. However, if the new memory setting is <b>smaller</b> than the previous value, the
existing contents of the window will be lost!</p>
<p><b>[Undo]</b> or <b>[Control]+[U]</b></p>
<p>This powerful option is used to erase every character edit,
movement and block operation that has been created in the current editing session. You simply keep
calling Undo to work back through the changes you made before calling Undo.</p>
<p>A call to CLOSE EDITOR or the running of a program will clear all
the Undo memory store.</p>
<p><b>[Redo]</b> or <b>[Control]+[Shift]+[U]</b></p>
<p>As a fail-safe against a hasty undoing operation, this option is
provided to re-write everything that has been erased by an [Undo].</p>
<h4>Block</h3>
<p>The [Block] Main Menu heading reveals all of the cut-and-paste
commands which enable the fast copying, movement and deletion of blocks of a program listing.
Here are all the options:</p>
<p><b>[On/Off]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[B]</b></p>
<p>Use this option to toggle between the Block mode and the normal
Editing mode. The same change is achieved by double clicking on the <b>left</b> mouse button.</p>
<p>As soon as the Block mode is entered, the text cursor is replaced
by a solid block cursor, at the current position.</p>
<p>A Block is set by holding down the <b>left</b> mouse button, and
dragging the cursor to the desired destination point. Alternatively, the dimension of the Block can
be set directly from the keyboard using the [Up Arrow] and [Down Arrow] keys. When a Block is set,
it will be marked by inverse video highlighting.</p>
<p>Unlike the original AMOS system, AMOS Professional Blocks can be
marked out in units of a single character, so the beginning and end Block positions should include
<b>whole</b> command words.</p>
<p>Blocks can be freely copied between different windows, by grabbing
a Block into memory from the source window with [Store] or [Ctr1]+[S], and then clicking in the
relevant line of the destination window followed by [Paste] or [Ctrl]+[P].</p>
<p><b>[All Text]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[A]</b></p>
<p>This selects <b>all</b> text in the current file, ready for block
operations.</p>
<p><b>[Store]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[S]</b></p>
<p>This option is used to store the marked Block into memory, ready
for a subsequent [Paste] operation. The highlighting of the Block will be removed, and you will be
returned to Editing mode.</p>
<p><b>[Cut]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[C]</b></p>
<p>This grabs the marked block into memory, and cuts it out of the
program listing completely.</p>
<p><b>[Paste]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[P]</b></p>
<p>To insert an exact copy of the Block at the current cursor
position, use this option for a Block that has been saved with a [Store] or a [Cut] option.</p>
<p><b>[Forget]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[F]</b></p>
<p>This option is used to erase a stored Block from the computer's
memory.</p>
<p><b>[Print]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[Shift]+[P]</b></p>
<p>If a printer is connected and ready to print, this option is used
to list the Block directly onto paper.</p>
<p><b>[Save]</b> or <b>[Ctrl]+[Shift]+[S]</b></p>
<p>This will save the Block as a normal AMOS Professional program. It
is vital that the start and end points of the Block are perfectly aligned, to avoid including
nonsense in the final program.</p>
<p><b>[Save ASCII] </b>or <b>[Ctrl]+[Shift]+[A]</b></p>
<p>This option saves the Block as an ASCII file. This allows it to be
edited by a commercial text editor.</p>
<h4>Search</h3>
<p>The [Search] menu provides all of the options that are used to
search through program listings, hunting for specific strings of characters. Once located, these
strings can be automatically replaced by alternative characters.</p>
<p>Users of the original AMOS and Easy AMOS systems will find several
new features here.</p>
<p>A Search dialogue box is called up by the relevant option, and
this is used to type in the string of characters to be sought. The search string can be up to 32
characters long and can include any combination of characters, words or instructions.</p>
<p>Normally all searches will be made forwards in pursuit of exact
matches of the given characters, but by selecting various options that are explained below, this can be
changed. Apart from menu options, there are two settings available from the dialogue box, as
follows:</p>
<p>[Backward]</p>
<p>If ticked for selection, the search will start from the current
cursor position backwards through the program listing.</p>
<p>[Upper Case = Lower Case]</p>
<p>If ticked, this ignores any distinction between upper and lower
case letters in the search string.</p>
<p>After the characters have been typed in, and any options selected,
the search is launched by pressing the [Return] key or clicking on the [OK] button.</p>
<p>If the search is successful, the cursor will be positioned over
the <b>first</b> character in the target string, otherwise a “Not found” message is displayed.</p>
<p>Current search preferences are kept, so that next time a search or
replace operation is carried out in the programming session, your selected options will be ready for
use.</p>
<p><b>[Search New]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[F]</b></p>
<p>This searches through the program for the <b>first</b> occurrence
of the selected string of characters, starting from the current cursor position.</p>
<p><b>[Search Next]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[N]</b></p>
<p>Use this option to search for the next occurrence of the string,
after a [Search New] or [Replace] operation.</p>
<p><b>[Search Previous]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[B]</b></p>
<p>This will search backwards through the listing until an example of
the target string is found, or the beginning of the program is reached.</p>
<p><b>[Replace New]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[F]</b></p>
<p>This replaces any string of characters or any AMOS Professional
instruction with your given text. The dialogue box for this option contains two editing zones:</p>
<p>The target characters that are to be located and then replaced are
to be found in the Search string. This will be the same as any previously called [Search] operation, or a
new string can be specified. The Replace string holds the text that will be substituted in place of
the original characters. Click on the appropriate zone using the <b>left</b> mouse button, or flick
between the Search and Replace strings using the [Tab] key.</p>
<p>As well as the [Backward] and [Upper Case = Lower Case] options,
two more settings are available when a Replace operation is chosen.</p>
<p>[All Occurrences]</p>
<p>This automatically replaces <b>every</b> instance of the target
string with the new characters. Obviously this can be a drastic operation, so you will be asked to confirm your
wishes before they are obeyed.</p>
<p>[All in Marked Block]</p>
<p>This restricts the Search and Replace operation to all instances
of the target characters within the currently highlighted Block.</p>
<p>Once the strings have been set, a Replace operation is commenced
by pressing [Return] or triggering the [OK] button. After a successful Replace operation, the cursor
is positioned immediately after the amended text. If the search fails, a “Not found” report will
be given in the title line.</p>
<p><b>[Replace next]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[N]</b></p>
<p>Use this option to scan the program listing for another example of
the search string. If this is successful, the cursor is placed immediately after the replaced
text.</p>
<p><b>[Replace Previous]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[B]</b></p>
<p>This checks backwards through the program listing, and replaces
the targeted characters with the replacement string entered by a [Replace New] option.</p>
<h4>Config</h3>
<p>The AMOS Professional editor can be totally re-configured,
allowing you to tailor it precisely to your own needs and preferences. All of the keyboard assignments can be
changed, all of the system messages may be freely customised and you can even assign existing
menu items directly to your own programs and call them straight from the screen!</p>
<p>This sort of feature allows you to use sophisticated techniques
with the utmost simplicity, making your programming truly professional.</p>
<p><b>[Show Keys]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[K]</b></p>
<p>As a default, all menu options have their equivalent keyboard
commands displayed alongside. This option is used to remove these explanations from the menus.
Keyboard short-cuts can still be used as normal, even if the constant reminders of their settings are
removed. A tick mark is added against this item to show that it has been selected.</p>
<p><b>[Insert Mode]</b> or <b>[F8]</b></p>
<p>This toggles the Editor between Insert and Overwrite mode, as
explained earlier in this Chapter.</p>
<p><b>[Sounds]</b></p>
<p>Sound effects may be used by the AMOS Professional Editor, and
this option loads a list of audio samples from the AMOSPro.Samples folder, providing accompanying
effects when various options are called up.</p>
<p>To turn these sound effects off, simply click on the [Sound]
option again. The creation of your own sound effects is dealt with in Chapter 8.2.</p>
<p><b>[Set Key Short-cut]</b></p>
<p>Most menu items can be assigned to an equivalent combination of
control keys. This allows menu commands to be accessed directly from the keyboard for extra
speed.</p>
<p>AMOS Professional is equipped with its own pre-defined set of
keyboard options, but these can be changed from the Editor at any time. Experienced AMOS programmers
and users of commercial word processing packages may want to change the AMOS Professional
layout to something more familiar, and any new definitions can be saved as part of the
configuration file. This means that your favourite keyboard settings will be available automatically, every
time you begin a programming session.</p>
<p>Setting a keyboard short-cut is extremely simple. Here is the
procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call the [Set Key Short-cut] option from the [Config] menu.</li>
<li>Select any target menu option. This can be any option except accessory items that are assigned 
to the [AMOS] Main menu heading.</li>
<li>Enter your keyboard short-cut directly from the keyboard. This can
comprise a single key press, as well as any combination of the [Shift], [Ctrl], [Alt],
[Amiga], [Function] or [Cursor Arrow] keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that AMOS Professional uses the scancode of keys, and not
their ASCII values. This means that the keys in the numeric' keypad can be assigned different
functions from the standard number keys. If a selected combination of keys is already in use, you
will be asked to confirm your choice before proceeding. Select [YES] to erase the original short-cut,
and replace it with your new setting.</p>
<p>Obviously, if these settings are played with casually, the
resulting confusion may be difficult to rectify. If this happens, reload the AMOS Professional standard settings
“AMOSPro.Configuration.Backup” from the file located within the “Extra_Configs” folder on the
“AMOSPro_System” disc.</p>
<p><b>[Set Program to menu]</b></p>
<p>This option allows any menu option to be replaced with a simple
call to an AMOS Professional program. This can be loaded from disc automatically, and executed
every time the appropriate menu option is called. Alternatively, the program can be permanently
installed in memory, ready for instant use.</p>
<p>If the program has been defined as an Editor Accessory with the
SET ACCESSORY instruction, it will even be able to call up a program listing directly, and display
the results on the Editor screen. This means that the Editor can be extended as much as you like! Please
see Chapter 13.1 for a complete explanation of this superb feature.</p>
<p>Here is the procedure for replacing a menu option with a program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call [Set Program to Menu] from the [Config] main menu heading.</li>
<li>After the prompt, select the menu item that you want to redefine,
which can be any option other than the Accessory list in the [AMOS] menu.</li>
<li>A standard File Selector will now appear, and is used to enter the
program that is to be assigned to the menu option.</li>
<li>Finally, enter your selection of run options from the following
items in the dialogue box which appears:</li>
</ul>
<p>[Command Line:]</p>
<p>This holds some text that will be available from the COMMAND LINE$
function when the program is run. If this is left blank, AMOS Professional will grab all of the
characters to the right of the Editor cursor into the COMMAND LINE$ string. This provides a simple way
of creating your own “Help” routines.</p>
<p>The program can be loaded in one of two ways:</p>
<p>[Load As Accessory]</p>
<p>This will load the program as an accessory, which will not be
available from the [AMOS] main menu heading, but will be hidden away in memory.</p>
<p>[Load in current window]</p>
<p>This saves the current program onto disc, and replaces it with the
new menu routine.</p>
<p>[Keep After Run]</p>
<p>After the program has been run, there are two alternative choices
as to what can happen:</p>
<p>[Un-ticked]</p>
<p>If the program was loaded as an accessory, it will be removed from
memory. If it was entered via the current window, it will be erased and the previous program will be
re-loaded automatically.</p>
<p>[Ticked]</p>
<p>The program will remain permanently in memory after it has been
run. It will be stored as an accessory or directly in the current window, depending on the
option that has been selected.</p>
<p><b>[Quit Options]</b></p>
<p>This menu controls what happens when you choose to quit the
Editor. A large dialogue box is displayed, offering these possibilities:</p>
<p>[Confirm Quit]</p>
<p>If this option is ticked, AMOS Professional will always ask for
confirmation before allowing you to quit.</p>
<p>[Save Configuration]</p>
<p>If the Editor configuration has been changed during the current
editing session, these changes will be saved directly into the “AMOSPro.Configuration” file in the
APSystem folder, before quitting.</p>
<p>[Save Macros]</p>
<p>This forces any new Macro definitions to be saved onto disc
whenever AMOS Professional is quit.</p>
<p>[Auto-resume]</p>
<p>If this option is selected, all programs in memory will be stored
on disc automatically, before allowing you to leave AMOS Professional. The next time AMOS Professional is
loaded, it will be restored to the exact state in which it was left. This important facility allows
the AMOS Professional programmer to re-commence work at the exact point and in the exact state of the
last working session!</p>
<p><b>[Autosave]</b></p>
<p>The Autosave feature provides a regular prompt to remind you that
all listings are to be saved to disc. A dialogue box is displayed at regular intervals for each program
in memory.</p>
<p>Selecting the [YES] button saves a program to disc, under its
present filename. If [NO] is chosen, the next program in the list is moved to.</p>
<p>The [Autosave] option offers a choice of the delay interval
between each reminder to save your programs, set in minutes. To turn the reminder system off, simply
enter a value of zero.</p>
<p><b>[Set Editor]</b></p>
<p>Use this option to reveal the following sub-menu, for setting your
own preferences.</p>
<p>[Setup]</p>
<p>The Editor set-up can be changed via the simple dialogue box
presented by this option. The AMOS Professional configuration is fully dealt with in Chapter 13.1.</p>
<p>[Colour Palette]</p>
<p>The On Screen colours can be set to your desired requirements when
you click on this menu item.</p>
<p>[Menu Messages]</p>
<p>This option allows you to change the default text of the menu
messages to your own wording, or into a non-English language. Menus are explained in Chapter 6.5, and
the menu editor is examined in Chapter 13.3.</p>
<p>[Dialog messages]</p>
<p>Similarly, the wording of the AMOS Professional dialogue boxes can
be changed. The whole of Section 9 of this User Guide is devoted to dialogue boxes, buttons
and icons, and Chapter 13.7 explains how to create your own resources.</p>
<p>[Test-Time Messages]</p>
<p>The information messages and error messages that appear when a
program is tested can also be changed. A full list of these messages is contained in Chapter
12.3.</p>
<p>[Run-Time Messages]</p>
<p>Similarly, the messages that are called up when a program is run
may be changed to your own wording. These are also listed in Chapter 12.3.</p>
<p><b>[Load Configuration]</b></p>
<p>When this option is selected, a named configuration file is
loaded, which holds all of your options for Editor settings.</p>
<p><b>[Load Default Configuration]</b></p>
<p>This option loads a file named AMOSPro.Configuration from the
APSystem folder, and the Editor is returned to its pre-set default settings.</p>
<p><b>[Save Default Configuration]</b></p>
<p>Use this option to save your own <b>current</b> settings as the default settings, into the default AMOSPro.Configuration file. These settings will then be presented
whenever AMOS Professional is run.</p>
<p><b>[Save Configuration]</b></p>
<p>This item is used to save the current configuration, ready to be
loaded with [Load Configuration].</p>
<p><b>[Set Interpreter]</b></p>
<p>Selecting this option will call up a special AMOS written
Accessory which allows you to define many special features of the AMOS Professional Interpreter. See Chapter
13.1 for further details.</p>
<p><b>User</b></p>
<p>The [User] Main Menu heading presents the options that are used to
create your own menu entries in the AMOS Professional Editor. These entries can be assigned to any
AMOS Professional program, and the selected program will be loaded and run whenever the assigned
option is selected. Please see the SET ACCESSORY command for details of .how to define Editor
Accessories, which can access the current program directly.</p>
<p><b>[Add Option]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[U]</b></p>
<p>When this option is selected, a dialogue box appears asking for
the name of the new option to be inserted at the first blank position in this [User] menu. The new
name can contain up to 16 letters, and there is a maximum of 20 available options.</p>
<p>After the new name has been typed in, you can assign a program to
the new option, using the [Set Program to Menu] command, which is called automatically during
this procedure. The new menu option can now be selected with the mouse, and the associated
program file can be chosen from disc. Finally, the [Set Key Short-cut] feature is presented, allowing a
keyboard equivalent to be selected immediately.</p>
<p><b>[Delete Option]</b> or <b>[Amiga]+[Shift]+[U]</b></p>
<p>This removes an option from the [User] menu. After selecting this
feature, you will be asked to choose an option to be deleted, using the mouse.</p>
<h4>Help</h3>
<p>Chapter 4.2 provides a detailed examination of the AMOS
Professional Help system. The [Help] menu offers a list of topics for which additional help is directly
available. Select the item that you need help with, and an instant explanation will be provided on
screen.</p>
<p><b>[Help]</b> or <b>[Help key]</b></p>
<p>Use this to call up a quick definition, explanation and syntax
example of any AMOS Professional instruction at the current cursor position. The program cursor
should be over the first character of the instruction with which you need assistance.</p>
<p><b>[Help Menu]</b></p>
<p>This calls up the Main Menu of the AMOS Professional Help system,
which is detailed in Chapter 4.2.</p>
<p>This Chapter explains how AMOS Professional provides detailed
on-screen help, co every aspect of the system and your programming.</p>
<p>The User Guide is provided to explain all the features of AMOS
Professional in detail, and to act as your instructor, but a large book can never offer the instant help
made possible by a computer program. AMOS Professional has been designed to be as friendly as
possible, and it harnesses the power of the Amiga itself to provide you with interactive Help in
your programming.</p>
<h2 class="Western">Calling for Help</h2>
<p>Help is available at the touch of a button, whenever you are in
edit mode. Simply press the [Help] key, it's as obvious as that! Alternatively, click on the [H] icon
at the top of the Edit Screen.</p>
<p>An additional list of Help options is also revealed by holding
down the right mouse button, dragging the mouse pointer to the [Help] menu, and selecting one of the
pre-set headings. To start with, select the [Main Menu] option from the [Help], menu, or simply press the
[Help] key, or click on the [H] icon. In all cases, the Main Menu will appear in a special Help
Window.</p>
<h2 class="Western">The Help Window</h2>
<p>Whenever [Help] is summoned, the AMOS Professional Help Window is
flicked onto the screen. If it obscures your listing, it can be repositioned by dragging the
title bar up and down. All options are selected via the left mouse buttons. At the left-hand side of the
title bar, there is a [Close] button, to return you to the Edit screen.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the bar there are three simple options:</p>
<p><b>[Prev Page]</b></p>
<p>Click on this to reveal the previous page that was called during
the helping process.</p>
<p><b>[Main Menu]</b></p>
<p>This option summons the Help system's Main Menu on screen.</p>
<p><b>[Print]</b></p>
<p>When this option is selected, you will be requested to check that
your printer is ready to receive the words of wisdom offered by the Help system. Simply click on [Ok]
to obtain a printed copy of the current Help text.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the Help window there is a vertical
slider bar and a pair of up/down arrows, enabling you to scroll through the Help text.</p>
<h2 class="Western">The Main Menu</h2>
<p>Using the AMOS Professional help system is completely
straightforward, extremely simple, and incredibly powerful!</p>
<p>The Main Menu presents a series of sub menus, as follows:</p>
<table>
<th colspan="2">Main Menu</th>
<tr><td>Using Help</td><td>Audio</td></tr>
<tr><td>Editor</td><td>AMOS Interface</td></tr>
<tr><td>Direct Mode</td><td>Input/Output</td></tr>
<tr><td>Syntax conventions</td><td>AmigaDos</td></tr>
<tr><td>Basics of AMOS</td><td>Debugging</td></tr>
<tr><td>Screen control</td><td>Machine code</td></tr>
<tr><td>Object control</td><td>Tables</td></tr>
<tf colspan="2">Latest News</tf>
</table>
<p>Please note that this Menu may not appear exactly as in this User
Guide listing, because we may have added more information since going to print.</p>
<p>If you need assistance with any of these topics, simply select
one.</p>
<p>Summoning direct Help during programming is explained later.
Please select the [Basics of AMOS] option now, to reveal a more detailed list of Help topics.</p>
<h2 class="Western">Sub-menus</h2>
<p>As soon as an item is triggered by the left mouse button from the
Help system Main Menu, a selection of related topics is revealed. Any of these new headings can now
be selected as before. In the case of the [Basics of AMOS] option that you have just selected, they
range from [The Bare Bones] to [Memory Banks]. Please select the [Text] option that is on your
screen now.</p>
<p>As you have probably guessed, all of the AMOS Professional
features relating to [Text] are now displayed on screen. Please select [Print] for a demonstration of
instant Help. Not only will this command be explained in the form of text on your screen, you will
also be invited to click on the highlighted instruction [Print] and be treated to an instant
demonstration program!</p>
<p>There is so much electronic Help on offer, that this User Guide
may seem redundant! Please keep reading anyway.</p>
<h2 class="Western">Summoning Help directly</h2>
<p>In the early stages of AMOS Professional programming, before you
become completely familiar with all the features, it is all too easy to loose track of the precise
format of every command. It can be very frustrating to consult this User Guide in the middle of
programming, and even using the various Help menus may break your concentration. To make programming as
painless as possible, Help can be summoned directly from your program listings!</p>
<p>To receive instant help on any command directly from the Editor,
type in the instruction that you are not sure about, or go to an instruction that is already in your
program, and position the cursor over the first letter of that word. Now press the [Help] key or click
on the [H] icon for instant assistance.</p>
<h2 class="Western">Additional help</h2>
<p>There is a complete range of additional help features available to
the AMOS Professional programmer. Here is a brief introduction to each of them.</p>
<h3>Error Messages</h3>
<p>If AMOS Professional encounters any problems with your listings, a
wide range of helpful messages is available to pinpoint the error. These error messages appear in
the Information Line Hear the top of the Edit Screen, and they fall into three main categories. Editing
messages can appear while you are in the process of editing your programs, such as “Line too long”.
Program messages like “FOR without matching NEXT” may be displayed when you [Test]your work, a lid
the program cursor will try to pinpoint where the problem is lurking in your listings. Run-time
messages come complete with their own number code, and they spotlight errors encountered while your
program is up and running.</p>
<p>A full list of these error messages can be found in Chapter 12.3,
along with an explanation of what they mean, and how to deal with the problem. Errors can usually be
“trapped”, and Chapter 12.2 is devoted to this sport.</p>
<h3>The AMOS Professional Monitor</h3>
<p>This feature is used to get inside your programs, examine any AMOS
professional routine, discover exactly what is happening, why it is happening and make a full
report on screen. The Monitor not only offers help, it provides an instant diagnosis! All is
explained in Chapter 12.1.</p>
<h3>Continuing Support</h3>
<p>It has always been our policy to provide as much help and support
to AMOS users as possible,and AMOS Professional programmers are offered this assistance too.
Future Support is dealt with in Appendix I, at the back of this User Guide, and you may well want
to join the network of world-wide clubs and groups offering a huge range of help and support to AMOS
Professional programmers. The services of the AMOS PD Library are detailed in Appendix H.</p>

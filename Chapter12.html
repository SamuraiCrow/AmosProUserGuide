<p>The Monitor</p>
<p>This User Guide can help you to overcome most problems in your programming, and the ready-made </p>
<p>HELP programs will demonstrate all of the techniques described in its pages. But a User Guide can </p>
<p>never   get   inside   your   own   programs   and   explain   what   is   going   on.   Believe   it   or   not,  AMOS </p>
<p>Professional can!</p>
<p>The AMOS Professional Monitor is a very simple idea, but it is also incredibly powerful. It may </p>
<p>summoned up to examine any AMOS Professional routine, or even a single expression. The Monitor </p>
<p>is used to find out exactly what is happening and why, and to make an instant report on screen.</p>
<p><b>Calling the Monitor</b></p>
<p>To call up the AMOS Professional Monitor from the Editor, simply click on the [Monitor] option in the </p>
<p>Project Menu, or press the [F5] key.</p>
<p><b>MONITOR</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: call AMOS Professional Monitor</i></p>
<p><b>Monitor</b></p>
<p>MONITOR is also a command in its own right, and can be typed from Direct Mode or included </p>
<p>anywhere in your program listing. When called from inside an AMOS Professional program, the </p>
<p>MONITOR  command   stops   the   program   and   summons   up   the   Monitor   Screen.   The   monitoring </p>
<p>process will then start from the location immediately after the MONITOR command, ready to step </p>
<p>through the program one instruction at a time. For example:</p>
<p>Print “Time to call the Monitor!”</p>
<p>Wait 100</p>
<p>Monitor</p>
<p>Print “This is the next instruction”</p>
<p>Before the next instruction is executed, the Monitor Screen appears, and the system is ready to be  </p>
<p>exploited.</p>
<p><b>Using the Monitor</b></p>
<p>The AMOS Professional Monitor is totally icon-driven and controlled by the mouse, so there is no </p>
<p>need   to   type   anything   at   all!   To   prepare   for   a   step-by-step   guide   of   the   Monitor,   you   are </p>
<p>recommended to load one of the demos on the AMOSPro Examples disc, so that the Monitor can  </p>
<p>analyse it.</p>
<p>If the Monitor screen is displayed, click on the quit icon [Q] in the top right-hand corner of the push-</p>
<p>button control keypad of the Monitor Screen, and load the following example now:</p>
<p>Load “AMOSPro_Examples:Examples/H-0/Help7.AMOS”</p>
<p>Run the example from the Editor, to remind yourself how it looks, then break into it with [Ctrl]+[C] </p>
<p>and press [Spacebar] to return to the Editor.</p>

<p>The Monitor</p>
<p>Now   trigger   the   [Monitor]   option   or   press   [F5],   and   the   Monitor   Screen   will   appear   looking </p>
<p>something like this:</p>
<p>The AMOS Professional Monitor has been designed to perform all of the following tasks:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>To examine the instructions in a program, one at a time, and to display a report showing the </p>
<p>result of what happens when its parameters have been evaluated. In other words, the Monitor </p>
<p>can test any instruction in any program.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>To display HELP information regarding any selected instruction.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>To supply the result of any expression in the program, where possible. If there is an error in </p>
<p>the expression, the offending line will be identified.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>To provide error message reports.</p>
<p>The Monitor screen is divided into four areas, as follows:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The top left-hand quarter is the <b>graphic output window</b>.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The top right-hand quarter is the <b>control keypad</b>.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The central lower screen is the <b>program listing window</b>.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The bottom lower screen is the <b>information window</b>.</p>
<p>12.01.02</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>N</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>R</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Monitor</p>
<p><b>The Graphic Output Window</b></p>
<p>The window that occupies the top left-hand quarter of the Monitor Screen displays the graphic output </p>
<p>of the current program screen. The screen number is displayed above it. Lowres screens are reduced </p>
<p>to exactly half of their original size, so that a 320x200 screen fits perfectly into this window. If the </p>
<p>screen is larger than this default size, it can be explored using the four directional arrow icons in the </p>
<p>push-button control panel. Hires screens are  <b>not</b>  reduced, and these are also examined using the </p>
<p>direction arrows.</p>
<p>All colour animations, including FLASH and FADE will be shown during the monitoring process. If  </p>
<p>the current screen features more than 16 colours, then colours 16 to 31, colours 41 to 47 and colours 48 </p>
<p>to 63 will each be converted to colours 0 to 15. Obviously HAM pictures may well generate some  </p>
<p>bizarre displays.</p>
<p>Experiment with the directional arrows, and then click anywhere in the graphic output window with </p>
<p>the left mouse button. This returns to the original program display for as long as the button remains </p>
<p>pressed, and is a useful feature to-remind you of exactly what is on the screen you are dealing with.</p>
<p><b>The Program Listing Window</b></p>
<p>This window gives you a view of the current program listing. Any items to be examined can be </p>
<p>marked out, but nothing in this window can be changed. Once the Monitor has been initialised, </p>
<p>helpful markers will be shown in the program listing, acting as reminders for the following points:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The current program location is marked by a black cursor with three small arrow-heads. It </p>
<p>always appears before the <b>next</b> instruction to be examined.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>You are allowed to set a “break point” in the listing, and these are marked in <b>inverse video</b>.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Any item that you want information about will be <b>underlined</b>.</p>
<p><b>The Information Window</b></p>
<p>This is where all of the Monitor information appears. It commences by displaying the next instruction </p>
<p>to be examined, but as more of the Monitor features become active, information is displayed in the  </p>
<p>following order, from top to bottom in this window:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Error messages</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Information on instructions</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The next instruction to be examined</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The first parameter of the next instruction</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The second parameter, the third parameter, and so on.</p>
<p><b>Changing the window displays</b></p>
<p>Scroll bars are provided to move the display of the program listing, vertically and horizontally in the </p>
<p>Program Listing Window. The “centre” button at the top right-hand corner of this window is used to </p>
<p>centre the display on the next instruction to be executed. A vertical scroll bar is also available for the  </p>
<p>Information Window.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Monitor</p>
<p>The horizontal line between the Program Listing Window and the Information Window can also be </p>
<p>dragged up and down, in order to enlarge one of these windows and reduce the other to a minimum </p>
<p>of three lines.</p>
<p><b>The control keypad</b></p>
<p>Each of the push-buttons in the control keypad is triggered via the mouse. Here is au explanation of </p>
<p>the controls.</p>
<p><b>Scrolling the screen output</b></p>
<p>The four directional arrows are used to scroll the reduced screen in the graphic output </p>
<p>window. The central button in this group selects the screen to be displayed, starting from </p>
<p>screen   zero,   and   then   in   order   through   any   additional   screens   until   screen   zero   is </p>
<p>displayed once more.</p>
<p><b>Initialising the Monitor</b></p>
<p>This is the Initialisation button, and it has exactly the same effect as using [Run] from the </p>
<p>Editor. Firstly, a [Test] of the program is performed. If AMOS Professional encounters an </p>
<p>error,   the   faulty   line   will   be   displayed   in   the   program   listing   window.   If   the   testing   process   is </p>
<p>successful and no errors are found, a Default command will be given and a program pointer will be </p>
<p>initialised at the first instruction in the program that is being monitored.</p>
<p>The [INIT] button <b>must</b> be triggered before the program listing can be checked, step by step.</p>
<p><b>One-Step Control</b></p>
<p>Clicking on this button tells the Monitor to examine the next instruction, give a report and then </p>
<p>go back and wait for your next action. The black program cursor will now be pointing to the </p>
<p>next instruction, and the Information Window will also show the next instruction and give any </p>
<p>parameter list.</p>
<p><b>Slow-Run Control</b></p>
<p>When this button is triggered, the Monitor will interpret instructions one at a time, and re-</p>
<p>draw the whole display after  each examination. By using this option, you can follow the </p>
<p>progress of the program listing in slow motion. To stop the slow-run, click on the stop button.</p>
<p><b>Stop Button</b></p>
<p>The stop button brings the interpretation process to a halt, and returns you to the Monitor. </p>
<p>Pressing [Ctrl]+[C] has the same effect, and so does a “break point”, which is explained below. </p>
<p>If a non-trapped error is discovered, it will be displayed in the Information Window and you </p>
<p>will also be taken back to the Monitor.</p>
<p><b>Normal-Run Control</b></p>
<p>This button will run the program from the Monitor and update the graphic display every 50th </p>
<p>of   a   second,   allowing   a   faster   speed   of   operation.   The   program   itself   and   the   Monitor </p>
<p>information windows will not be updated until a stop in the program. To stop the process, </p>
<p>simply use the stop button.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Monitor</p>
<p><b>Fast-Run Button</b></p>
<p>When fast-run is used, the program's own display is used and the program is run at full speed. </p>
<p>If an error is not found, the only way to return to the Monitor during a fast-run is to press </p>
<p>[Ctrl]+[C], or use break points.</p>
<p><b>Break Point Button</b></p>
<p>Click   on   the   break   point   button   with   the   left   mouse   button   as   usual,   then   click   on   the </p>
<p>instruction in the program listing wherever you wish to <b>set</b> the break. The instruction will be </p>
<p>highlighted in inverse video. To <b>remove</b> a break point, click on an area which is adjacent to the </p>
<p>highlighted listing, such as the area without any commands or text to the right of the program lines.</p>
<p><b>Evaluation Button</b></p>
<p>The button marked [VAL] allows you to use a very accurate setting for the evaluation process. </p>
<p>Click on the button and then use the mouse to set the individual character that marks the </p>
<p>beginning   of   the   expression   to   be   evaluated.   With   the   button   held   down,   drag   it   to   the </p>
<p>character in the listing to mark the end of the expression you are interested in, and release the button </p>
<p>to underline the expression. The evaluation will now be reported in the Information Window.</p>
<p><b>Help Button</b></p>
<p>Click on the help button [?], then click on the instruction you need help with. The keyword will </p>
<p>be underlined, and the trusty AMOS Professional Help Window will appear, at your service.</p>
<p><b>Quit</b></p>
<p>This button takes you back to the Editor. If the Monitor system has been called up from inside  </p>
<p>a   program   using   the   MONITOR  command,   you   will   be   returned   to   the   program   at   the </p>
<p>instruction immediately after that command.</p>
<p><b>Evaluating expressions</b></p>
<p>The Monitor may be simple to use, but it is incredibly skilful in the way it analyses expressions, and </p>
<p>reports the results back to you. Here are the ground rules for a simple demonstration. First, run this </p>
<p>example to give yourself something to work on, and then call up the Monitor.</p>
<p>A=1 : B=2 : C=3</p>
<p>D=A+B*C-1</p>
<p>Print D</p>
<p>Initialise the program by clicking on the [INIT] button. If you were to press [VAL] and ask for an  </p>
<p>evaluation of A+B without first initialising B, you would be asking for the impossible. Also, if you </p>
<p>asked for an evaluation of “k”, you would be told that it is not possible to evaluate something that is </p>
<p>plainly idiotic! On the other hand, if you ask for an evaluation of something self evident, like “1”, it  </p>
<p>will be given. Also, the expression must be at the same level of procedure as the program pointer.</p>
<p>12.01.05</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>N</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>R</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Monitor</p>
<p>With the black program cursor still on the first line of the example program, trigger [VAL] and ask for </p>
<p>an evaluation of D by clicking on “D” in the last line of the example. The result of zero will be given! </p>
<p>D will only be equal to A+B*C-1 when all the expressions have been evaluated.</p>
<p>Advance the process by one step by pressing the appropriate one-step button on the control panel, </p>
<p>and the cursor moves to the next expression on the first line. Now advance two more steps, and get </p>
<p>the correct evaluations for A,B and C, from the second line of the program. D will still come back as </p>
<p>zero, but by advancing another step, D is given as 6.</p>
<p>To get rid of an expression from the Information Window, just click on it with the mouse cursor.</p>
<p>That was a very simple example, of course. However, when dealing with complex programs, you can </p>
<p>use the Monitor with the greatest of ease to extract all sorts of interesting results from the expressions </p>
<p>in the listing. Explore one of the AMOS Professional example programs now, and test out the Monitor </p>
<p>on the most complex expressions you can find.</p>
<p>12.01.06</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>N</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>R</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Error Handling</p>
<p>When AMOS Professional encounters an error in your programs, or if you attempt the impossible, </p>
<p>automatic assistance is offered in the form of error messages displayed in the information line. If this </p>
<p>happens while you are programming, you can try to correct the mistake immediately. If the problem </p>
<p>is found when you try to test or run a program, AMOS Professional will take you to the offending line </p>
<p>as soon as you edit.</p>
<p><b>Trapping errors</b></p>
<p>Routines can be set up in advance for handling errors inside an AMOS Professional program, so that </p>
<p>when   a   mistake   is   spotted,   error   trapping   swings   into   action.   This   process   is   triggered   by   the </p>
<p>following command:</p>
<p><b>ON ERROR</b></p>
<p><i>structure: trap an error within a Basic program</i></p>
<p><b>On Error Goto</b> label</p>
<p>By this method, when an error occurs in your Basic program, a jump is made to whatever label has </p>
<p>been defined. This label acts as the starting point for your own error correction routine, and after the </p>
<p>mistake has been corrected you can return to your main program without the need to go via the </p>
<p>editor window. Try this simple routine:</p>
<p>Do</p>
<p>Input “Type in two numbers”;A,B</p>
<p>Print A;“ divided by “;B;” is ”;A/B</p>
<p>Loop</p>
<p>This will work perfectly until you try to enter a value of zero for B and it is discovered that division  </p>
<p>by zero is impossible. Such unforeseen problems can be catered for by setting an error trap like this:</p>
<p>On Error Goto HELP</p>
<p>AGAIN:</p>
<p>Do</p>
<p>Input Type in two numbers”;A,B</p>
<p>Print A; divided by ;B;” is ”;A/B</p>
<p>Loop</p>
<p>Rem Error Handler</p>
<p>HELP:</p>
<p>Print</p>
<p>Print Sorry, you have tried to divide”</p>
<p>Print “your number by zero.”</p>
<p>Resume AGAIN : Rem Go back to input</p>
<p>If you are unfortunate enough to write an error inside your own error trapping routine, AMOS </p>
<p>Professional will grind to a halt! There are two ways to deliberately disable ON ERROR GOTO.</p>
<p>On Error : Rem disable error trap</p>
<p>12.02.01</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>S</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Error Handling</p>
<p>Call ON ERROR without any parameters like that, or force it to go to zero, like this:</p>
<p>On Error Goto 0</p>
<p>To get back to your program after ON ERROR has been called, you must use RESUME. Never use </p>
<p>GOTO for this purpose.</p>
<p><b>RESUME</b></p>
<p><i>structure: resume the execution of current program after an error trapping routine</i></p>
<p><b>Resume</b></p>
<p><b>Resume Next</b></p>
<p><b>Resume</b> labelname</p>
<p><b>Resume</b> linenumber</p>
<p>Used on its own, RESUME will jump back to the statement which caused the error and try it again. To </p>
<p>return   to   the   instruction   immediately   after   the   one   that   caused   the   error,   use   RESUME   NEXT. </p>
<p>Alternatively, to jump to a specific point in your main program, simply follow RESUME with a </p>
<p>reference to a chosen label or a normal line number.</p>
<p><b>ON ERROR PROC</b></p>
<p><i>structure: trap an error using a procedure</i></p>
<p><b>On Error Proc</b> name</p>
<p>Errors can also be trapped using a procedure. ON ERROR PROC selects a named procedure which is </p>
<p>automatically called if there is an error in the main program. In fact, this is a structured version of the </p>
<p>ON ERROR GOTO command. In this case, your procedure must be terminated by an END PROC in </p>
<p>the usual way, then return to the main program with an additional call to RESUME, which can be </p>
<p>placed just before the final END PROC statement. Here is an example:</p>
<p>On Error Proc HELP</p>
<p>Do</p>
<p>Input “Type in two numbers”;A,B</p>
<p>Print A;“ divided by “;B;” is ”;A/B</p>
<p>Loop</p>
<p>Rem Error Handler</p>
<p>Procedure HELP</p>
<p>Print</p>
<p>Print “Sorry, you have tried to divide”</p>
<p>Print “your number by zero.”</p>
<p>Resume Next: Rem Go back to input</p>
<p>End Proc</p>
<p>When using a procedure to deal with errors, and you want to jump to a particular label, a special </p>
<p>marker must be placed inside that procedure. This is achieved with the RESUME LABEL structure.</p>
<p>12.02.02</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>R</p>

<p>O</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>S</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Error Handling</p>
<p><b>RESUME LABEL</b></p>
<p><i>structure: jump to a label after an error has been isolated using a procedure</i></p>
<p><b>Resume Label</b> label</p>
<p>This defines the label which is to be returned to after an error. It must be called outside of your error </p>
<p>handler, immediately after the original ON ERROR PROC or ON ERROR GOTO statement. For an </p>
<p>example of RESUMEL ABEL, please see the last routine in this Chapter.</p>
<p><b>ERRN</b></p>
<p><i>function: return the error code number of the last error</i></p>
<p>number=<b>Errn</b></p>
<p><b>Print Errn</b></p>
<p>When you use ON ERROR to create error handling routines, you will want to know exactly what sort </p>
<p>of error has happened in the main program. Errors discovered while your program is running each </p>
<p>have a specific error code number, and the number of the last error to be isolated can be returned by </p>
<p>using the ERRN function.</p>
<p><b>ERROR</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: deliberately generate an error and return to Editor</i></p>
<p><b>Error</b> number</p>
<p>Supposing you have set up an error handling routine and you want to test your programming skills. </p>
<p>The   ERROR   command   offers   a   simple   method   of   simulating   various   mistakes   without   all   the </p>
<p>inconvenience of waiting for them to happen. To test this system, select the error of your choice using  </p>
<p>the error code numbers listed in the next Chapter. For example:</p>
<p>Error 88</p>
<p>That will quit your program and display a Disc full error message, simulating what would happen </p>
<p>when your current disc gets filled with data. You may also combine ERROR with the ERRN function, </p>
<p>to print out the current error condition, after a problem in your program:</p>
<p>Error Errn</p>
<p>Finally, ERROR can be used with RESUME LABEL inside an error handling routine, to jump straight </p>
<p>back to a label set up with the previous command. For example:</p>
<p>On Error Proc HELP</p>
<p>Resume Label WELCOME</p>
<p>Error 88</p>
<p>Print “This line is never printed”</p>
<p>WELCOME : Print “Hello! Hello! I'm back again!”</p>
<p>End</p>
<p>Procedure HELP</p>
<p>Print “There seems to be an error!”</p>
<p>Resume Label</p>
<p>Endproc</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Error Handling</p>
<p><b>TRAP</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: trap an error</i></p>
<p><b>Trap</b> instruction</p>
<p>The   TRAP   command   offers   a   much   sleeker   error-trapping   service   than   an   ON   ERROR   GOTO </p>
<p>structure, and it is used to detect errors for a particular instruction. The TRAP instruction is used </p>
<p>before any normal AMOS Professional instruction with <b>no</b> colon between them, and it disables the </p>
<p>error system for the specified instruction. This means that if an error occurs, the program will not be </p>
<p>halted, but the number of the error will be reported instead. This number can then be returned by the </p>
<p>ERRTRAP function, explained below. Here is an example of trapping a disc access error:</p>
<p>Trap Load “File.Abk”,10</p>
<p>If Errtrap : Print “Disc Error!” : End If</p>
<p>TRAP will only detect an error for the instruction that immediately follows, so in the next example the </p>
<p>second usage of the LOCATE instruction <b>will</b> cause an error!</p>
<p>Trap Locate -1,-1 : Locate -1,-1</p>
<p><b>ERRTRAP</b></p>
<p><i>function: return an error code number after a TRAP</i></p>
<p>number=<b>Errtrap</b></p>
<p>This function is used to return the error status after a previous TRAP command. If no error has been </p>
<p>detected,   a  zero  s   returned,   otherwise   the   appropriate   error   number   is  given.   The   related   error </p>
<p>message can then be returned using the ERR$ function, explained next.</p>
<p><b>ERR$</b></p>
<p><i>function: return an error message string</i></p>
<p>text$=<b>Err$</b>(error number)</p>
<p>This simple function returns an error message string. If the error number is out of range, then an </p>

<p>AMOS Errors</p>
<p>AMOS Professional offers several sets of error messages to help you correct your  programming </p>
<p>mistakes. Editing error messages may appear while you are in the middle of programming. Program </p>
<p>error messages can happen when you test your work. Run time messages come complete with their </p>
<p>own number code, and they pinpoint errors while your program is running. Error messages appear in </p>
<p>the information line of your screen, and are automatically displayed to help and inform you.</p>
<p><b>Editing error messages</b></p>
<p>While you are editing programs, one of the following messages may appear.</p>
<p><b>Bottom of text</b></p>
<p>The text cursor has come to the last line of your current program.</p>
<p><b>Cannot delete warm-start information!</b></p>
<p>You've tried to use AMOS Warm-start system on a Write protected disc. AMOS won't reload until the </p>
<p>“AMOSPro.LastSession” has been successfully deleted. Remove the protection and try again. If the </p>
<p>problem persists, you'll have to delete the file manually. It's in the APSystem folder.</p>
<p><b>Cannot hide the last window</b></p>
<p>AMOS Professional always requires at least one window on the screen at any one time. So you can't </p>
<p>hide the final window away as an accessory.</p>
<p><b>Cannot load configuration</b></p>
<p>If you've tried to load a new configuration using the option in the [Config] menu, and the file you  </p>
<p>have selected is not valid then this error will be generated. It will also appear in the CLI or Workbench </p>
<p>if AMOS Professional cannot load the default configuration when it is being booted or re-loaded after </p>
<p>a KILL EDITOR command. A backup copy of the default configuration file can be found in the </p>
<p>Extra_Configs folder on the AMOSPro System disc.</p>
<p><b>Cannot load included file</b></p>
<p>The INCLUDE command can't find your chosen include file. Check that it's available in one of your </p>
<p>drives.</p>
<p><b>Cannot save configuration</b></p>
<p>AMOS  can't save  your  configuration file  onto  your  start-up  disc.  This  error  can  occur  if  you've </p>
<p>selected the [Save Configuration] feature from the [Quit Options] menu or when saving from the </p>
<p>menu item in the [Config] menu. If there's not enough space on your boot-disc, or it's write protected, </p>
<p>you'll get an error.</p>
<p><b>Cannot save editor set-up: warm start not enabled</b></p>
<p>AMOS Professional cannot save the AMOSPro.LastSession file or cannot save one of the program files </p>
<p>being worked on. This can happen for many reasons - disc protected, no disc in drive, disc full etc. If </p>
<p>this happens, the next warm-start procedure is aborted and the next time you boot up you'll have an </p>
<p>empty editor.</p>
<p><b>Disc error</b></p>
<p>The Editor has been unable to load a configuration file, include file, or library from the </p>
<p>current disc. If the file is on a floppy, try re-inserting it a couple of times. If all else </p>
<p>fails, use DISCDOCTOR to salvage your data and try again with a fresh disc.</p>

<p><b>Editor command not runnable</b></p>
<p>ASK EDITOR and CALL EDITOR can only be used by EDITOR ACCESSORIES. These are normal </p>
<p>programs with a SET EDITOR command at the start.</p>
<p><b>Editor function not found</b></p>
<p>You've used an incorrect function number in an ASK EDITOR or CALL EDITOR command.</p>
<p><b>Error in previous program</b></p>
<p>There was a problem with the accessory program you've called up with PRUN, or accessed from the </p>
<p>USER MENU. If possible, bring up the listing on the screen, and try running the program again from </p>
<p>an editor window. You should spot the error immediately.</p>
<p><b>Line too long</b></p>
<p>You've tried to enter a line into the editor which is longer than the maximum of 251 characters. If  </p>
<p>possible, split the line into a number of smaller pieces.</p>
<p><b>Mark not defined</b></p>
<p>This error is generated using the [Goto] system mark and [Goto] user mark from the [Editor] menu. </p>
<p>You are only allowed to jump to a mark if it's been previously defined from the editor. User marks are </p>
<p>created  by  you,  but System  marks are  generated automatically whenever  you move through  an </p>
<p>AMOS program listing. However, if you call them straight after a program has been loaded, you can </p>
<p>still get this error.</p>
<p><b>No errors</b></p>
<p>No errors have been detected in the current program during the testing process.</p>
<p><b>No macros defined</b></p>
<p>If you try to clear macros when there are none set-up this message will be displayed.</p>
<p><b>No more Redo</b></p>
<p>You've run out of things to redo. You can only redo lines which have been previously recalled by the </p>
<p>UNDO command. So every REDO matches exactly one UNDO operation.</p>
<p><b>No more Undo</b></p>
<p>You've reached the end of the stored key presses used by the undo option. If you've got enough </p>
<p>memory, AMOS Professional will happily allow you to undo the entire editing session a character at a </p>
<p>time.</p>
<p><b>Not a procedure</b></p>
<p>You are trying to use the [Procedure Open/Close] options, but the text cursor is not positioned over a  </p>
<p>procedure.</p>
<p><b>Not an AMOS program</b></p>
<p>You've attempted to load the wrong sort of program into the Editor. AMOS Professional is compatible </p>
<p>with all versions of AMOS and Easy AMOS. But you can't load .AMOS format compiled programs </p>
<p>created from the original AMOS Compiler.</p>

<p>AMOS Errors</p>
<p><b>Not done</b></p>
<p>This “error” is generated when you abort from an operation such as [Load], [New], or [Quit] I corn </p>
<p>the Editor. It's also produced when the editor is unable to comply with your instructions.</p>
<p><b>Not found</b></p>
<p>A SEARCH or REPLACE operation from the Editor has been unable to find your requested search </p>
<p>string.</p>
<p><b>Out of buffer space</b></p>
<p>The AMOS Professional Editor stores each program listing in an internal “memory buffer”. If you run </p>
<p>out of space in this buffer, you'll get an “Out of buffer space” error. The solution is to use the [Set Text  </p>
<p>Buffer] function from the [Editor] menu to increase the allocation. Each extra byte can hold a single </p>
<p>character in your program listing. Note that providing you INCREASE the memory buffer, your </p>
<p>current   program   listing   will   be  perfectly   safe.   If   you   reduce   it   however,   it   will   be  erased   from </p>
<p>memory!</p>
<p>The most common cause of this problem is when you select the “Automatic Adaptation” option after </p>
<p>loading a large file. This will reserve just 254 bytes for your editing operations. If you click on [No], </p>
<p>AMOS will automatically call [Set Text Buffer] so that you can expand the memory buffer to a more </p>
<p>sensible size.</p>
<p><b>Out of Editor memory</b></p>
<p>You've tried to load an AMOS program which is too large to fit into the available memory. If you've </p>
<p>several windows open, try closing some of them to grab back a little extra space. Don't forget to save </p>
<p>any changes first! Also check the amount of available memory with the [Information] option from the </p>
<p>[Project]   menu.   If   there   seems   to   be   plenty   of   Ram,   you've   probably   suffered   from   a   memory </p>
<p>fragmentation problem. Save your programs, and re-boot your Amiga from scratch.</p>
<p><b>Out of memory</b></p>
<p>There is no more memory available to hold the current programs. Using the CLOSE WORKBENCH </p>
<p>instruction can restore 40k of memory used by the Workbench screen.</p>
<p><b>Out of memory: Cannot load program</b></p>
<p>This error is generated when there isn't enough memory to hold an accessory program assigned to </p>
<p>one of the Editor options. It's also produced by the PRUN command. The solution is to free up as </p>
<p>much memory as possible by closing any unused windows. If you still can't call the program, save  </p>
<p>any changes and re-boot AMOS Professional from scratch. This re-initialises the Amiga's memory </p>
<p>system and provides the maximum storage space your AMOS programs.</p>
<p><b>Please choose a RELOCATABLE PROGRAM!</b></p>
<p>The [Insert Program] option from the [Editor/Procedures] menu only works with 68000 machine code </p>
<p>programs in PC relative (relocatable) format. If you've included instructions which move directly to a </p>
<p>fixed memory location, your assembler will have placed extra relocation information at the end of </p>
<p>your machine code. This cannot be used by AMOS Professional, so your program will be rejected out </p>
<p>of hand.</p>

<p><b>Sorry! Editor configuration not recoverable!</b></p>
<p>AMOS Professional has attempted a Warm-start. In order to work it needs to be able to find the  </p>
<p>“AMOSPro.LastSession” file from the APSystem folder. If this is corrupted, or write-protected, you'll </p>
<p>get an error when you try to load AMOS Professional. If you've write-protected the disc, remove the  </p>
<p>protection, and try again. If it still fails to load, delete the “AMOSPro.LastSession” file from the CLI </p>

<p><b>Too many direct mode variables</b></p>
<p>Normally, you are allowed to create up to 64 new variables while in direct mode. If your program is </p>

<p>may need to add an AREXX WAIT command before your instruction. Also check that you've opened </p>
<p>the correct Arexx communications port.</p>
<p><b>No zones defined (73)</b></p>
<p>This   is   an   error   generated   by   the   RESET   ZONE   command.   RESET   ZONE   erases   all   the   zone </p>

<p>AMOS Errors</p>
<p><b>Not an AmigaDOS disc (92)</b></p>
<p>AMOS Professional can only read discs created on an Amiga. If you want to use discs that are of </p>
<p>compatible size but originate from another sort of computer, you will first have to use specialised </p>
<p>software to translate the data.</p>
<p><b>Not a med module (189)</b></p>
<p>The MED LOAD command is only capable of loading music modules which are compatible with the </p>
<p>MED music format. So check that the music is in the correct format.</p>
<p><b>Not a packed bitmap (200)</b></p>
<p>You have attempted to unpack a data bank which is not in bitmap format.</p>
<p><b>Not a packed screen (201)</b></p>
<p>The data you are trying to unpack is not in packed screen format.</p>
<p><b>Not a tracker module (186)</b></p>
<p>The TRACKER LOAD command is only capable of loading music modules which are compatible </p>
<p>with the popular NOISETRACKER music format.</p>
<p><b>Out of data (33)</b></p>
<p>You may have left out some information from one of your DATA lines, because a READ command has </p>
<p>gone past the last item of data in the current program. Alternatively, there may be a typing error in a </p>
<p>RESTORE command.</p>
<p><b>Out of internal memory (printer device) (167)</b></p>
<p>The printer device cannot cope with what you've requested. This Commodore internal error may vary </p>
<p>upon the device.</p>
<p><b>Out of memory (24)</b></p>
<p>Your Amiga thinks that it has run out of available memory storage space. If the information line </p>
<p>assures you that there is plenty of spare memory, simply save your program, re-boot and load the </p>
<p>program back in. There are commands which will free up memory when you start reaching the </p>
<p>Amiga's limits. These are: CLOSE EDITOR, KILL EDITOR and CLOSE WORKBENCH.</p>
<p><b>Out of memory (parallel device 172), (printer device 166), ( serial device 148)</b></p>
<p>If a device requires memory and finds that there's no more left, one of the above will be reported  </p>
<p>back.  Try adding the CLOSE WORKBENCH or  CLOSE EDITOR commands at the start of your </p>
<p>program to free up some additional memory.</p>
<p><b>Out of stack space (0)</b></p>
<p>There   are   too   many   procedure   calls   nested   inside   one   another.   Although   AMOS   Professional </p>
<p>procedures can call themselves up, this error may be reported after about 50 loops. The same can </p>
<p>happen with the GOSUB command. See the SET STACK command if you need to extend this limit.</p>
<p><b>Out of variable space (11)</b></p>
<p>Normally, AMOS Professional allocates 8k of storage space for your strings and arrays. To </p>
<p>increase variable space,  use the SET BUFFER command at the beginning of your </p>
<p>program.</p>

<p>AMOS Errors</p>
<p><b>Overflow (29)</b></p>
<p>The result of a calculation has exceeded the maximum size of a variable.</p>
<p><b>POP without GOSUB (2)</b></p>
<p>POP   can   only   be   executed   inside   a   subroutine   which   was   previously   gone   to   with   a   GOSUB </p>
<p>command. To exit from a procedure, use POP PROC.</p>
<p><b>Parallel device already used (171)</b></p>
<p>The PARALLEL OPEN command can only be used ONCE in your program. If you've already opened </p>
<p>the   printer   port   with   PRINTER   OPEN,   the   parallel   device   may   not   be   available   for   your   use. </p>
<p>Alternatively, if your Amiga has several of these parallel ports you might need to access the devices </p>
<p>directly using the DEV OPEN command.</p>
<p><b>Parallel initialisation error (177)</b></p>
<p>The parallel device has refused to open probably because another program is using it.</p>
<p><b>Parallel line error (174)</b></p>
<p>The PARALLEL SEND, PARALLEL INPUT$ or PRINTER SEND commands have been unable to </p>
<p>access the parallel port. Check than the cables are plugged firmly into the connectors, and try again.</p>
<p><b>Parallel port reset (176)</b></p>
<p>Commodore documentation is vague on this error. We guess it's due to a Parallel printer being turned </p>
<p>off or the connectors being unplugged during transmission.</p>
<p><b>Program interrupted (9)</b></p>
<p>You have pressed the [Ctrl] and [C] keys at the same time, to exit directly from your program, or used </p>
<p>a STOP instruction. This is an information message, not an error.</p>
<p><b>Printer cannot output graphics (162)</b></p>
<p>The PRINTER DUMP command can only dump your screens onto printers which support some sort </p>
<p>of graphics mode. This applies to the vast majority of printers currently on the market, and includes </p>
<p>ANY normal dot-matrix or laser printer. However, if you're using a daisy wheel printer, you'll be </p>
<p>unable to make use of this feature. Sorry!</p>
<p><b>RETURN without GOSUB (1)</b></p>
<p>RETURN can only be used to exit from a subroutine that was originally entered with a GOSUB.</p>
<p><b>Rainbow not defined (75)</b></p>
<p>You must define your rainbow effect using SET RAINBOW before you can call it up.</p>
<p><b>Resume label not defined (6)</b></p>
<p>The label you have specified in a RESUME command does not exist.</p>
<p><b>Resume without error (7)</b></p>
<p>The RESUME command cannot be executed unless an error has been discovered in your program.</p>

<p>There is no sample bank in memory.</p>
<p><b>Screen already in double buffering (69)</b></p>
<p>You cannot call DOUBLE BUFFER more than once on the same screen.</p>
<p><b>Screen not in dual playfield mode (71)</b></p>
<p>You may only use DUAL PRIORITY after creating a dual playfield.</p>
<p><b>Screen not opened (47)</b></p>
<p>You must open a screen with the SCREEN OPEN command before it can be accessed.</p>
<p><b>Screens can't be ANIMated (67)</b></p>
<p>AMAL can only move or scroll screens. It is impossible to animate screens using the built in Anim </p>
<p>command.</p>
<p><b>Scrolling zone not defined (72)</b></p>
<p>Before using the SCROLL command, the direction and size of the scrolling area must be defined with </p>
<p>SET SCROLL.</p>
<p><b>Selected unit already in use (160)</b></p>
<p>The unit number can be specified for Serial communications and this error will occur if the requested  </p>
<p>unit is in use. You'll need to have a special multi-serial board though!</p>
<p><b>Serial device already in use (145)</b></p>
<p>Another application is using the serial device and has forbidden access to other programs.</p>
<p><b>Shift declaration error (53)</b></p>
<p>There is a mistake in the colour sequence used in a SHIFT UP or SHIFT DOWN instruction.</p>
<p><b>Sprite error (105)</b></p>
<p>The values entered into a SPRITE command are outside of the required limits. Check this User Guide </p>
<p>for the correct parameters.</p>
<p><b>String too long (21)</b></p>
<p>AMOS Professional allows a maximum of 65000 characters in any string.</p>
<p><b>Syntax error in animation string (107)</b></p>
<p>There is an error in the animation sequence specified by an Anim command. Check for typing errors, </p>
<p>especially for full stops instead of commas.</p>
<p><b>Text window 0 can't be closed (62)</b></p>
<p>The WIND CLOSE command can only close windows which have been defined using WIND OPEN. </p>
<p>So it won't close the original text window.</p>
<p><b>This window has no border (63)</b></p>
<p>A BORDER command has been used on a window which has no border.</p>

<p><b>Time-out error (155)</b></p>
<p>The SERIAL INPUTS command or SERIAL GET command have waited in vain for information over </p>
<p>the serial channel. They've finally aborted with an error. Check that everything is connected correctly, </p>
<p>and that the other end of the communications line is actually sending you some data. This time-out  </p>
<p>limit can be set from the Workbench Preferences.</p>
<p><b>Too many colours in flash (51)</b></p>
<p>There is a maximum allowance of 16 colour changes in a single FLASH command.</p>
<p><b>Type mismatch (34)</b></p>
<p>An illegal value has been assigned to a variable. The following line shows two classic Type mismatch </p>
<p>errors:</p>
<p>A$=23 : B=“A string into an integer?”</p>
<p><b>User cancelled request (161)</b></p>
<p>The printer was not available to the printer device, a system requester appeared and you clicked on </p>
<p>Cancel and then this error occurred.</p>
<p><b>User function not defined (15)</b></p>
<p>There's a problem with a user defined function created with DEF FN. AMOS can't find the function </p>
<p>you are referring to. Check that you've defined your function earlier in your program with DEF FN. </p>
<p>This line must occur BEFORE your FN function actually appears in the listing! You can't create your </p>
<p>function as part of a procedure, or a subroutine.</p>
<p><b>Valid screen numbers range from 0 to 7 (50)</b></p>
<p>There is a maximum of eight screens that can be opened at any one time.</p>
<p><b>Wave 0 and 1 are reserved (182)</b></p>
<p>Waves 0 and 1 are automatically reserved for white noise and pure tones respectively. So you can't </p>
<p>redefine them using the SET WAVE command.</p>
<p><b>Window already opened (55)</b></p>
<p>It is impossible to open a window that is already open.</p>
<p><b>Window not opened (54)</b></p>
<p>You are trying to access a window that does not exist, because it has not been opened.</p>
<p><b>Window too large (57)</b></p>
<p>It is impossible to open the requested window, because its dimensions are too large to fit into the  </p>
<p>current screen.</p>
<p><b>Window too small (56)</b></p>
<p>The requested window is smaller than the minimum permitted size. Please see WIND OPEN and </p>
<p>WIND SIZE for a full explanation.</p>

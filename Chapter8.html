<p>Music</p>
<p>This Chapter explains how to exploit the superb sound capabilities of the Amiga. It will deal with </p>
<p>simple sound effects and the use of music in AMOS Professional programs.</p>
<p>Generally, the sound capabilities of a television set are terrible. To release the full potential of AMOS </p>
<p>Professional stereo sound, a hi-fi system or personal stereo should first be connected to the Amiga's </p>
<p>pair of stereo phono sockets. </p>
<p>All AMOS Professional sound commands operate independently from games and utility routines, so </p>
<p>that they can never interfere with your programming. On the contrary, they should enhance your </p>
<p>work in any way that you chose, acting as markers, adding realism, soothing, shocking or providing </p>
<p>comic relief.</p>
<p><b>Ready-made sound effects</b></p>
<p>Any imaginable sound effect can be used in an AMOS Professional program, whether it is natural, </p>
<p>synthetic, pre-recorded or composed by you. In fact the choice is so vast that the next two Chapters </p>
<p>are   devoted   to   the   wonders   of   sound   samples!  A  whole   bank   of   pre-recorded   effects   has   been </p>
<p>prepared for your use, but there are three common sound effects that can be called up by their own </p>
<p>commands and used for testing and punctuating your routines.</p>
<p><b>BOOM</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: generate explosive sound effect</i></p>
<p><b>Boom</b></p>
<p>By   making   use   of   interrupts   to   simulate   “white   noise”,   the   BOOM   command   plays   a   realistic </p>
<p>explosive sound effect. This does not delay the program at all, so it may be necessary to use WAIT </p>
<p>between successive explosions, or to create ricochet and echo effects For example:</p>
<p>Curs Off : Centre “Thunderbolt and Lightning”</p>
<p>Flash 1, “(FFF,1)(000,147)(A5F,2)”</p>
<p>Boom : Wait 150: Boom : Cls</p>
<p>Centre “Very Very Frightening”</p>
<p>Wait 50 : Boom</p>
<p><b>SHOOT</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: generate percussive sound effect</i></p>
<p><b>Shoot</b></p>
<p>The SHOOT command generates a simple sound effect in exactly the same way as BOOM.  For </p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>Shoot : Wait 25: Shoot : Print “Ouch!”</p>
<p><b>BELL</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: generate pure tone</i></p>
<p><b>Bell</b></p>
<p><b>Bell <i></b>pitch</i></p>
<p>Unlike the built-in explosive sound effects, BELL produces a simple pure tone.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Music</p>
<p>The frequency or “pitch” of this sound can be changed by adding a pitch value after the BELL </p>
<p>command, ranging from 1 for a very deep ring, up to 96 for an ultra high pitched sound. You can hear  </p>
<p>the range of frequencies with this example:</p>
<p>For F=1 To 96</p>
<p>Bell F : Wait F/10+1 : Rem Vary delay</p>
<p>Next F</p>
<p><b>Musical pitch</b></p>
<p>The values from 1 to 96 that are used to control the pitch of the BELL sound correspond to the notes </p>
<p>on the keyboard of a piano. The white key at the extreme left-hand side of the keyboard is known as  </p>
<p>Bottom C, and corresponds to pitch value 1. Value 2 is the equivalent to the black note next to it,  </p>
<p>which is a C#, and so on up to “Middle C” at pitch value 37, then all the way up to 96. Grand piano </p>
<p>keyboards run out of notes after 88, and most synthesizer keyboards have a lot less than that.</p>
<p>In Western music, notes are given their own code letter so that musicians can all refer to the same </p>
<p>pitch when they try and play together. These letters repeat themselves after twelve notes, and each </p>
<p>group of twelve is known as an “octave”.</p>
<p>Here is a table of pitch values, along with their musical note equivalents and octave groupings.</p>

<p><b>Channels and voices</b></p>
<p>The Amiga produces sound like a river, and AMOS Professional allows you to split this river into four </p>
<p>separate channels, all pouring out at the same time, but each capable of individual control. These </p>
<p>channels can be heard individually, or mixed together, or directed to the left and right creating stereo </p>
<p>sound. They can also be individually increased and decreased in volume, or dammed up altogether.</p>
<p>Each of these channels can be given a different “voice”, and each voice can be controlled in terms of </p>
<p>volume and direction.</p>

<p><b>VOLUME</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: control sound volume</i></p>
<p><b>Volume</b> level</p>
<p><b>Volume</b> <i>voice</i>,level</p>
<p>The VOLUME command controls the level of sound flowing through one or more channels, ranging </p>
<p>from zero (complete silence) up to 63 (ear-splitting), like this:</p>
<p>For L=0 To 63</p>
<p>Volume L: Bell 80 : Wait 5</p>
<p>Next L</p>
<p>Once the VOLUME level has been set, all future sound effects and music will be delivered at that </p>
<p>level, across all four channels. In order to create stereo effects and perfect sound mixes, each of the  </p>
<p>voices needs to be adjusted independently from one another.</p>
<p><b>VOICE</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: activate voice</i></p>
<p><b>Voice</b> bit-mask</p>
<p>Soundtracks  are  made  up  of   one  or   more  voices,   acting   independently   or   together.   The   VOICE </p>
<p>command is used to activate voices by setting a bit-mask, with each bit representing the state of one of </p>
<p>the four available channels through which the voices flow. To play the required voice (from 0 to 3) </p>
<p>simply set the relevant bit to 1, otherwise a value of zero will keep the voice silent. Here are some </p>
<p>example settings:</p>
<p>Voice %1111 : Rem Activate all voices</p>
<p>Voice %0001 : Rem Activate voice 0 only</p>
<p>Voice %1001 : Rem Activate voices 3 and 0</p>
<p>The volume of each voice can now be controlled by specifying voices and volumes, like this:</p>
<p>Volume %0001,63</p>
<p>Boom : Wait 100: Rem Channel 1 loud</p>
<p>Volume %1110,5</p>
<p>Boom : Wait 50: Rem Channels 2,3,4 soft</p>
<p>Bell 40 : Wait 50 : Volume 60: Bell 40</p>
<p>Here are some common values for voice settings, that can be used to make programming a little </p>
<p>easier:</p>

<p><b>Playing notes</b></p>
<p><b>PLAY</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: play a voice</i></p>
<p><b>Play</b> pitch,delay</p>
<p><b>Play</b> <i>voice</i>,pitch,delay</p>
<p><b>PLAY OFF</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: stop a voice playing</i></p>
<p><b>Play Off</b></p>
<p>Patterns of individual notes can be played, allocated to any voice, given a pitch and delayed for  </p>
<p>pause, using just one PLAY command.</p>
<p>The voice parameter is optional, allowing notes to be played through any combination of the Amiga's </p>
<p>four voices, and is set by the usual bit-map format.</p>
<p>The pitch parameter uses the values from 1 to 96, which correspond to the notes in the table given  </p>
<p>earlier. Delay sets the length of any pause between this PLAY command and the next instruction in </p>
<p>the program, with a value of zero starling the note and immediately going on to the next command.</p>
<p>The next example demonstrates this technique, including stereo harmonies:</p>
<p>Play 1,40,0: Play 2,50,0: Rem No delay</p>
<p>Wait Key</p>
<p>Play 1,40,15: Play 2,50,15: Rem Delay</p>
<p>Rem Play a random sequence of notes</p>
<p>Do</p>
<p>V=Rnd(1 5): P=Rnd(96): Play V,P,3</p>
<p>Loop</p>
<p>PLAY is not restricted to pure notes. It is possible to assign complex wave forms to voices, using the </p>
<p>WAVE and NOISE commands, which are explained next. To stop the playing process, simply turn it </p>
<p>off like this:</p>
<p>Play Off</p>
<p><b>Making waves</b></p>
<p>Every individual sound has its own identity pattern, which is the equivalent of an audio fingerprint. </p>
<p>This is because each sound is composed of its own unique frequencies. In the same way that a </p>
<p>hospital monitor displays a moving “wave” which pulses in lime to the frequencies of a heartbeat, </p>
<p>different sounds create their own wave forms. For example, a cymbal crash has a wave form of jagged </p>
<p>peaks very close together, whereas the smooth harmonics of a cello make much more rounded waves.</p>

<p>Music</p>
<p>With AMOS Professional, the shape of a wave form is set using a list of 256 numbers, with each </p>
<p>number representing the intensity of an individual section of the wave.</p>
<p><b>SET WAVE</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: define a wave form</i></p>
<p><b>Set Wave</b> number,shape$</p>
<p>The SET WAVE command sets the wave form of an individual sound, that can then be used at various </p>
<p>pitches to create music or sound effects. This command requires two parameters, the number of the </p>
<p>wave to be set, followed by the shape of this pattern, held in a string.</p>
<p>Wave numbers zero and 1 are already allocated, so these numbers should not be used. Wave zero </p>
<p>holds a random noise pattern, used to generate the explosive effects of BOOM and SHOOT, while </p>
<p>wave number 1 is a smooth pattern in the shape of a sine wave, which is used as the “template” for </p>
<p>the pure tones needed by the PLAY and BELL commands. So when setting your new wave patterns, </p>
<p>use the identification numbers from 2 upwards.</p>
<p>Setting the parameter for the shape of the wave form is a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Each one of the 256 numbers which make up the shape of the wave form sets a single level of intensity </p>
<p>for that single part of the wave. Each one of these intensities can hold a possible value ranging from </p>
<p>-128 up to 127. Look at the diagram below. The vertical scale represents this range of intensities (-128 </p>
<p>to 127) and the horizontal scale shows the physical length of the wave form, in other words the </p>
<p>individual moments of time as the wave is played (256).</p>
<p>This   triangular   wave   pattern   does   not   make   a   very   exciting   sound,   but   it   serves   as   a   simple </p>
<p>introduction to making your own wave forms.</p>
<p>Because AMOS Professional strings can only hold <b>positive</b> numbers from zero to 256, the negative </p>
<p>values in this wave form need to be converted before use. This is extremely easy, and is achieved by </p>
<p>adding 256 to the negative numbers in the list! In other words, a value of -50 would be entered as 206, </p>
<p>like this:</p>
<p>-50+256=206</p>

<p>Music</p>
<p>The following program shows how the sort of wave form in the above diagram could be created The </p>
<p>wave form is then assigned to a wave and played, which is explained a little later.</p>
<p>S$</p>
<p>=“ ” : Rem Clear wave form string</p>
<p>For W=-128 To 127</p>
<p>X=W : If X&lt;0 Then Add X,256</p>
<p>S$=S$+Chr$(X)</p>
<p>Next W</p>
<p>Set Wave 2,S$</p>
<p>Wave 2 To 15: For S=10 to 60: Play S,10: Next S</p>
<p>The wave forms of musical instruments are much more complicated than the last example, but they </p>
<p>are not too difficult to reproduce. By combining several sine waves together, with each sine wave </p>
<p>having a different starting point, the type of pattern shown in the next diagram is achieved.</p>
<p>This sort of wave form generates smooth harmonics, which can then be used as the “templates” for </p>
<p>musical notes, and the sort of routine in the next example can produce typical sine waves:</p>
<p>SHAPE$=“ ” : Degree</p>
<p>For S=0 To 255</p>
<p>V=Int((Sin(S)/2+Sin(S*2+45)/4)*128)+127</p>
<p>SHAPE$=SHAPE$+Chr$(V)</p>
<p>Next S</p>
<p>Set Wave 2,SHAPE$ : Wave 2 To 15</p>
<p>For N=10 To 60: Play N,10 : Next N</p>
<p><b>WAVE</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: assign a wave to sound channel</i></p>
<p><b>Wave</b> number <b>To</b> voices</p>
<p>The WAVE command is used to assign the specified wave number to one or more sound channels.</p>

<p>Music</p>
<p>The voice parameter contains a bit-map in the standard format, and if a bit pattern is set to 1 then the </p>
<p>appropriate voice is used to PLY the sound. Remember that wave number zero is already reserved for </p>
<p>the NOISE channel, and wave number 1 contains a smooth sine wave for pure tone. Here are some </p>
<p>examples:</p>
<p>Wave 1 To %1111 : Rem Play pure tone through all voices</p>
<p>Play 60,0</p>
<p>Wave 0 To %0001 : Rem Use voice 0 for noise</p>
<p>Play 20,10</p>
<p><b>NOISE TO</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: assign noise wave to sound channel</i></p>
<p><b>Noise To</b> voices</p>
<p>This command has the same effect as assigning the white noise wave form number zero to the </p>
<p>selected voices, and it is used to form the foundations for a whole range of special effects, such as </p>
<p>explosions and percussion drumming. The bit-pattern used to set one or more voices has already been </p>
<p>explained above. Here is an example:</p>
<p>Noise To 15 Rem All four voices</p>
<p>Play 60,50</p>
<p>Play 30,0</p>
<p><b>SAMPLE</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: assign a sample to the current wave</i></p>
<p><b>Sample</b> number <b>To</b> voices</p>
<p>This is the most powerful of the wave commands. SAMPLE is used to assign the specified sound </p>
<p>sample number, which is already stored in the Sample Bank, directly to the current wave form. The </p>
<p>voices to be used are set in the usual way. When PLAY is used, this sample will be taken from the  </p>
<p>Sample Bank and used as the “musical instrument” to be played. Try this example:</p>
<p>Load “AMOSPro_Examples:Samples/Mixture.Abk”,6</p>
<p>Sam Bank 6</p>
<p>Sample 5 To 15</p>
<p>For S=20 To 50</p>
<p>Play S,50</p>
<p>Next S</p>
<p>The pitch values that  can  be  applied to  any particular  sample will  vary,  but  normally  anything </p>
<p>between 10 and 50 is satisfactory.</p>
<p><b>DEL WAVE</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: delete a wave</i></p>
<p><b>Del Wave</b> number</p>
<p>To delete a wave that has been set up with a SET WAVE instruction, simply use this command </p>
<p>followed by the number of the wave to be erased.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Music</p>
<p>When this has been done, all deleted voices will be set to the standard default sine wave. The pre-set </p>
<p>wave numbers zero and 1 can be manipulated, but they <b>cannot</b> be eradicated.</p>
<p><b>Making audio envelopes</b></p>
<p>An “envelope” is audio jargon for how a sound is manipulated during the brief period of tin that it is  </p>
<p>played. In other words, whether it bursts into life or makes a more subtle entry (attack), whether it </p>
<p>fades away with dignity or lives life to the full (decay), how long it hangs on for (sustain) and finally, </p>
<p>the manner in which it meets its end (release). All of this is achieved simply by changing the volume  </p>
<p>of individual sections of the wave form.</p>
<p><b>SET ENVEL</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: create a volume envelope</i></p>
<p><b>Set Envel</b></p>
<p> wave number,phase number </p>
<p><b>To</b></p>
<p> duration,volume</p>
<p>AMOS Professional uses envelopes to change your original wave forms according to a set pattern. The </p>
<p>parameters are as follows:</p>
<p>The wave number sets the wave form to be affected, and any number can be used <b>including</b> the pre-</p>
<p>set wave numbers zero and 1.</p>
<p>The phase number refers to one of seven individual sections of the original wave form that is to be  </p>
<p>defined, ranging from 0 to 6.</p>
<p>The duration controls the length of this particular segment (phase number) of the wave form, and is </p>
<p>expressed in units of one 50th of a second. This is how the speed of a volume change in any phase of </p>
<p>the wave form is controlled.</p>
<p>Volume specifies the volume to be reached by the <b>end</b> of this phase, ranging from zero for silence up </p>
<p>to 63 for full blast.</p>
<p>In the next example, an envelope for wave form number one is set, so that segment zero (its first  </p>
<p>phase) lasts for four seconds, ramping up to full volume by its end, no matter what the original </p>
<p>volume was at the start of this phase.</p>
<p>Set Envel 1,0 To 200,63</p>
<p><b>LED ON</b></p>
<p><b>LED OFF</b></p>
<p><i>instructions: toggle audio filter</i></p>
<p><b>Led On</b></p>
<p><b>Led Off</b></p>
<p>Most tape recorders and hi-fl systems have some sort of filtering system to ”clean” up sound by </p>
<p>eliminating the high frequencies that generate unwanted hiss. When filters are used, there is always a </p>
<p>trade off between overall sound quality and clear definition.</p>
<p>08.01.08</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>U</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>C</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Music</p>
<p>For example, although some distortion may be eliminated, certain percussion sounds will be robbed </p>
<p>of their characteristics. The LED filter changes the way these high frequencies are treated by the </p>
<p>system,   but   by  using   the   LED   OFF   command,   you   can   recapture   the   essential   quality   of   many </p>
<p>instrumental sounds.</p>
<p>The difference made by the LED filter can be clearly heard in the following example:</p>
<p>Load “AMOSPro_Examples:Music/Music.Abk”</p>
<p>Music 1</p>
<p>Do</p>
<p>If Mouse Key=1 Then Led On: Print “LED ON!”</p>
<p>If Mouse Key=2 The Led Off : Print “LED OFF”</p>

<p><b>Playing music</b></p>
<p>The AMOS Professional music system allows backing tracks to be added to any program. Music can </p>
<p>be   created   from   a   variety   of   sources,   including   original   samples   and   compositions,   which   are </p>
<p>explained   in   the   following   two   Chapters.   These   backing   tracks   are   converted   into   the   AMOS </p>
<p>Professional format, and held in the Music Bank.</p>
<p>Music tracks are loaded with the MUSIC command, volume is controlled by MVOLUME, and speed </p>
<p>by MVOLUME. Individual music passages can be halted using the MUSIC STOP instruction, and all </p>
<p>music is halted by MUSIC OFF.</p>

<p>Samples</p>
<p>This Chapter explains how to make use of sampled sound to enhance your programs. For users </p>
<p>restricted to the Amiga's internal floppy drive, AMOS Professional allows a range of superb “live” </p>
<p>sound effects and musical tones to be called up. If you have access to a hard drive or CD- ROM, the </p>
<p>AMOS Professional Double Buffered Sampling system offers full exploitation of sampled sound. </p>
<p>There is even a built-in “recording studio” ready to be used, and you can enjoy the facilities of this </p>
<p>Sample Bank Maker accessory, which is featured in Chapter 13.6 of this User Guide.</p>
<p>Modern computers are able to store sound frequencies in the form of digits. Your Amiga is a digital </p>
<p>sound synthesizer, and AMOS Professional is ready, willing and able to harness its power. There are </p>
<p>many digital sound samplers on the market, ready to be plugged into your computer for grabbing </p>
<p>sound samples off CD, cassette, radio and microphone. Unfortunately there are two restrictions in </p>
<p>enjoying   these   sources   for   digital   sound.   Firstly,   sampler   cartridges   are   rather   expensive,   and </p>
<p>secondly, stealing other people's audio creations is illegal! Luckily, there are thousands of public </p>
<p>domain   sound   effects   and   musical   instrument   samples   that  AMOS   Professional   can  import   and </p>
<p>transform for your own purposes, perfectly and legally. AMOS Professional sound samples are held </p>
<p>in their own memory banks, and bank number 5 is usually held as the default sample bank.</p>
<p><b>Playing a sound sample</b></p>
<p><b>SAM PLAY</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: play a sound sample from the sample bank</i></p>
<p><b>Sam Play</b> sample number</p>
<p><b>Sam Play</b> <i>voice</i>,sample number</p>
<p><b>Sam Play</b> <i>voice</i>,sample number, <i>frequency</i></p>
<p>The SAM PLAY command is used to play a digital sound sample through your audio system. Simply </p>
<p>define the number of the required sample held in the bank. There is no limit to the number of samples </p>
<p>that can be stored, other than available memory.</p>
<p>There   are   two   optional   parameters   that   can   also   be   given.   A  voice   parameter   can   be   placed </p>
<p>immediately   after   the   SAM   PLAY   command,   in   front   of   the   sample   number.   This   is   a   bitmap </p>
<p>containing a list of the voices the sample will use. There is one bit for each of the four available voices,  </p>
<p>and to play a voice the relevant bit should be set to 1, as explained in the last Chapter. The other  </p>
<p>parameter can be given after the sample number, and this governs the frequency of the sound. The </p>
<p>frequency parameter sets the speed at which the sample will be played back, and the setting is given </p>
<p>in Hertz. This is a professional standard of measurement, but as a rule of thumb, a rate of 4000 is </p>
<p>acceptable for simple sound effects, with 10000 for recognisable speech. By changing this playback </p>
<p>rate, the sample pitch can be adjusted over a very wide range, allowing a single sample to generate  </p>
<p>many different sounds.</p>

<p>This simple command is used to stop all samples playing through your loudspeaker system. If it is </p>

<p>Samples</p>
<p><b>Changing a sample bank</b></p>
<p>Digital   sound   samples   are   normally   stored   in   memory  bank   5,   but  there   are   no   restrictions   on </p>
<p>assigning other banks to hold samples.</p>
<p><b>SAM BANK</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: change the current sample bank</i></p>
<p><b>Sam Bank</b> bank number</p>
<p>The SAM BANK instruction dictates that all future SAM PLAY commands will take samples from the </p>
<p>newly specified memory bank. If several parallel banks are set up, AMOS Professional can swap </p>
<p>between them with a simple call to the SAM BANK command. To hear all of the samples used in one </p>
<p>of the AMOS Professional example games, load the following file and listen to what is stored in the  </p>
<p>memory bank, using this routine:</p>
<p>Load “AMOSPro_Productivity:Wonderland/Wonderland Samples.Abk”</p>
<p>Sam Bank 6</p>
<p>For A=1 To 5</p>
<p>Print “Sample number ”;A</p>
<p>For B=1 To 3</p>
<p>Sam Play A</p>
<p>Wait 20</p>
<p>Next B</p>
<p>Next A</p>
<p><b>Playing a sample from memory</b></p>
<p>Samples do not have to be held in a special bank. In fact, a “raw” sound sample can be stored </p>
<p>anywhere in the computer's memory using BLOAD, and then played with the following command:</p>
<p><b>SAM RAW</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: play a raw sample from memory</i></p>
<p><b>Sam Raw</b> voice,address,length,frequency</p>
<p>SAM RAW plays a raw sample, and can be used to scan through any program or sound library discs, </p>
<p>searching for a sample that matches the given parameters.</p>
<p>The voice parameter has already been explained. Address refers to the location address of the sound </p>
<p>sample, which is normally inside an AMOS Professional memory bank, but can be anywhere. The </p>
<p>length parameter confirms the length in bytes of the sample to be played. Finally, frequency dictates </p>
<p>the playback speed of the original sample,given in Hertz.</p>
<p>A typical raw sample command looks like this:</p>
<p>Reserve as work 10,21480</p>
<p>R$=“AMOSPro_Examples:Samples/Mixture.Abk”</p>
<p>Bload R$,Start(10)</p>

<p><b>SAM LOOP OFF</b></p>
<p><i>instructions: toggle repetition of a sample</i></p>
<p><b>Sam Loop On</b></p>
<p><b>Sam Loop Off</b></p>
<p>There are many instances where a single sample needs to be repeated over and over again. SAM </p>
<p>LOOP ON ensures that all sound samples which follow this instruction will be looped continuously. </p>
<p>To turn off the looping facility,simply call the SAM LOOP OFF command. Add a SAM LOOP ON  </p>
<p>instruction to the last example, before the SAMRAW command, and hear the result.</p>
<p><b>Double buffered sampling</b></p>
<p>Samples are ideal for generating realistic sound effects directly from AMOS Professional programs. </p>
<p>However,   as   the   samples   get   longer,   their   memory   requirements   become   prohibitive!   If   sound </p>
<p>samples   are   used   sparingly,   several   seconds   of   perfect   audio   effects   can   be   conjured   up   by   an </p>
<p>unexpanded Amiga. Unfortunately, continuous soundtracks would seem like an impossibility, with </p>
<p>one minute of digital sound consuming almost a megabyte of data!</p>
<p>Owners of the basic Amiga machine will be forced to use most memory for routines and screens, but </p>
<p>AMOS Professional can offer hard drive users an alternative sampling technique, allowing the entire </p>
<p>disc to be treated as “virtual” memory. This means that instead of loading an entire sound sample as a </p>
<p>single block, it can be played a section at a time directly from disc. The only limitation to the size of  </p>
<p>such samples is the amount of free space in the storage facility.</p>
<p>The principle of Double Buffered Sampling is very similar to the display system employed by the </p>
<p>screen Double Buffer. It works by storing two sample banks in memory, the <b>physical</b> and the logical </p>
<p>sample banks.</p>
<p>The physical bank holds the sample which is currently being played through your loudspeakers, and </p>
<p>the logical bank contains the sample that is being loaded from disc.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a program, the physical and logical banks are loaded with the first two blocks of  </p>
<p>sample data. The physical sample can then be played with a SAM RAW command, and whenever the </p>
<p>physical bank runs out of information, the banks are swapped over to create a seamless audio signal. </p>
<p>The logical bank now becomes the physical bank, and vice versa.</p>
<p>AMOS Professional provides three powerful commands used to control this process directly. SAM </p>
<p>SWAP activates double buffered sampling, SLOAD  loads a specific section of the sample file in </p>
<p>memory, and the SAM SWAPPED function checks for the need to load a new block of sample data.</p>
<p>Here is the procedure for using double buffered sampling:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Reserve two memory banks in CHIP Ram, to hold the logical and physical samples. The size of </p>
<p>these banks will depend on the playback frequency, and the amount of background graphics. </p>
<p>It is good practice to start with a small value, such as 8k, and then increase this value until the </p>
<p>resulting sound effect is perfect.</p>

<p>•</p>

<p>using the SAM SWAPPED function. A value of -1 (True) will indicate the need to load the next </p>
<p>segment of sample data with</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>The swapping system is then re-initialised by SAM SWAP, and the process continues.</p>
<p><b>SLOAD</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: load a section of a sample</i></p>
<p><b>Sload</b></p>
<p> channel number </p>
<p><b>To</b></p>
<p> address,length</p>
<p>The SLOAD instruction is an extended version of the BLOAD command, and it is designed to load </p>
<p>selected parts of a file into memory, one section at a time.</p>
<p>First give the channel number of a sample file stored on disc, which has been previously opened with </p>
<p>an OPEN IN instruction. This is followed by the destination address of the data in memory. This will </p>
<p>normally be the start address of an AMOS Professional memory bank. Finally, the length of the </p>
<p>sample section is given, in the form of the number of bytes to be loaded into memory. These bytes will </p>
<p>be loaded directly from the current position of the file pointer, and this pointer may be moved </p>
<p>anywhere in the file, using the POF function. This means that you have complete control over the </p>
<p>starting point of the loading operation. Obviously, if the requested position lies outside of the current </p>
<p>file, an error will be reported. If the length is larger than the actual file, AMOS Professional will read </p>
<p>all of the remaining bytes up to the end of the file.</p>
<p>After the data has been successfully loaded, the file pointer will be moved to the next byte in the </p>
<p>sample automatically.</p>
<p>It should be apparent that the SLOAD command can be used for applications other than sample </p>
<p>loading. It will work equally well with any drive, including the internal floppy drive, but only a hard </p>
<p>disc,  Ram-disc or  <b>CD  ROM</b>  will be fast  enough to  load  samples,  for  use  with  the  SAM  SWAP </p>
<p>command! This is explained below.</p>
<p><b>SSAVE</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: save a data chunk anywhere into an existing file</i></p>
<p><b>Ssave</b> channel number, start <b>To</b> end</p>
<p>This command is the reverse of SLOAD. It allows you to save a chunk of memory data into a file </p>
<p>opened with OPEN OUT or APPEND. Use the LOF, POF and EOF functions to control where you </p>
<p>want to position the data within the file.</p>

<p>Samples</p>
<p><b>SAM SWAP</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: activate sample-switching</i></p>
<p><b>Sam Swap</b> voices <b>To</b> address,length</p>
<p>The SAM SWAP command activates the automatic sound-swapping system. It specifies the location </p>
<p>and size of a logical sample which has been loaded previously with the SLOAD instruction. The </p>
<p>sample will be played through loudspeakers the instant that the current physical sample runs out of </p>
<p>data.</p>
<p>The voices parameter is a bit-pattern that defines which voices are to be used for playing the sample.  </p>
<p>Each bit in this pattern sets the swapping on a particular voice, according to the following format:</p>
<p>Voice</p>
<p>3210</p>
<p>Bitmap</p>
<p>%1111</p>
<p>The address parameter gives the address of the next logical sample in memory. This address must be </p>
<p>in CHIP Ram. Length is simply the number of bytes to be played of the new section of sample.</p>
<p>It is essential to note that SAM SWAP only works with an existing sample. It does not actually play a </p>
<p>sample through a loudspeaker. Therefore, it has to be initialised by a SAM RAW command before it </p>
<p>can be used, which will start off the physical sample and set up the playback speed for the entire </p>
<p>sample of sound. For example:</p>
<p>Sam Raw %0011,Start(5),20000,12000 : Rem 12000 is the playback speed</p>
<p>Rem Swap the samples assigned to voices 0 and 1 using data in bank 6</p>
<p>Sam Swap %0011,Start(6),20000 : Rem 20000 is the length of logical sample</p>
<p><b>SAM SWAPPED</b></p>
<p><i>function: test for successful sample swap</i></p>
<p>value=<b>Sam Swapped</b>(voice number)</p>
<p>Use the SAM SWAPPED function to test the specified voice to see if the logical and physical samples </p>
<p>have been exchanged by a SAM SWAP command. The voice number is a value from zero to 3, and if </p>
<p>the sample is being played on a number of voices simultaneously, any of those voice numbers can be </p>
<p>used.</p>
<p>SAM SWAPPED will make a report by giving one of the following three values:</p>
<p><b>-1</b>  means   that   the   previous   physical   sample   has   finished   playing,   and   the   samples   have   been </p>
<p>successfully swapped. It is now time to load a new sample into the logical memory bank, and call the </p>
<p>SAM SWAP command again. Please note that this value is also returned after a normal SAM RAW </p>
<p>command has finished playing a sample.</p>

<p>Samples</p>
<p><b>Zero</b>  means that the physical sample is currently being played, and there is a fresh logical sample </p>
<p>waiting for the automatic switching operation. In this case, there is no need to load any further </p>
<p>information into memory.</p>
<p><b>1</b>  means that the sample player has run out of data, and that the sample swapping operation has </p>
<p>failed.   You   will   now   need   to   re-initialise   the   sample   from   the   beginning,   using   a   SAM   RAW </p>
<p>command. If this value is repeatedly given, your logical and physical sample banks are probably too </p>
<p>small. Try increasing their size to the next sensible value.</p>
<p>The SAM SWAPPED function should be called at regular intervals while the sample is being played. </p>

<p>Playing Music modules</p>
<p>A complete range of facilities I provided for playing music composed with the AMOS Professional </p>
<p>system, as well as module created with the popular Tracker and Med systems.</p>
<p><b>Playing AMOS Professional music</b></p>
<p>Any pieces of AMOS Professional music that are to be used with your programs must be held in the </p>
<p>Music Bank, which is normally Bank 3. These musical pieces can be played without affecting tiny </p>
<p>other part of the main program. If sound effects are triggered on a channel that is currently playing </p>
<p>music, the tune will be suspended while the sound effect is performed, and will start again from its </p>
<p>last position once the effect is over.</p>
<p>Several musical arrangements can be stored in the same bank, provided that there is enough memory, </p>
<p>and to identify melodies each piece of music must be given its own number.</p>
<p><b>MUSIC</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: play a piece of AMOS Professional music</i></p>
<p><b>Music</b> number</p>
<p>The MUSIC command is used to start playing the specified melody. Up to three different melodies </p>
<p>can be started at the same time, but each new MUSIC instruction will halt the current melody and </p>
<p>hold its status in a stack. When the new song has ended, the original music will start again exactly </p>
<p>where it left off. Here is a ready-made melody to load and play:</p>
<p>Load “AMOSPro_Examples:Music/Music.Abk”</p>
<p>Music 1</p>
<p>If you do not want your music to play through to the end, it can be halted in either of the two  </p>
<p>following ways.</p>
<p><b>MUSIC STOP</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: stop a single passage of music</i></p>
<p><b>Music Stop</b></p>
<p>This instruction brings the current single passage of music to a halt. If there is any other active music </p>
<p>held in the stack and waiting to be played, that music will begin to play at once.</p>
<p><b>MUSIC OFF</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: turn off all music</i></p>
<p><b>Music Off</b></p>
<p>The   MUSIC   OFF   command   is   used   to   turn   off   all  AMOS   Professional   music   in   your   program </p>
<p>completely. After this command has been called, the sound track can only be re-started by executing a </p>
<p>MUSIC command all over again.</p>
<p><b>MVOLUME</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: set the volume of a piece of music</i></p>
<p><b>Mvolume</b> level</p>
<p>To set the volume of a piece of music, or to change its current volume, this command is </p>

<p>Playing Music Modules</p>
<p>Obviously, by setting up a simple loop, you can fade your music up or down.</p>
<p><b>TEMPO</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: change the speed of a piece of music</i></p>
<p><b>Tempo</b> speed</p>
<p>Changing the volume or speed of music and sound effects can enhance the mood of most programs. </p>
<p>The TEMPO command is used to modify the speed of the current melody, and must be followed by a </p>
<p>number ranging from 1 for as slow as possible, up to 100 for incredibly fast. Here is an example of </p>
<p>music mood changing:</p>
<p>Load “AMOSPro_Examples:Music/Music.Abk”</p>
<p>Music 1</p>
<p>Do</p>
<p>For X=0 To 63</p>
<p>Tempo X: Mvolume X</p>
<p>Wait 10: Next X</p>
<p>Loop</p>
<p>Please note that music created using the Tracker and MED systems may include their own tempo and </p>
<p>volume labels, and these will override the settings specified by AMOS Professional.</p>
<p><b>Playing Tracker modules</b></p>
<p>If you are unable or unwilling to write your own musical masterpieces, there is no need to worry.  </p>
<p>AMOS Professional lets you take other composers' soundtracks and add them to your original games </p>
<p>and utilities. There are thousands of public domain soundtracks written with various systems, and to </p>
<p>make life easy, you are provided with a range of commands that will play the latest Soundtracker </p>
<p>modules.</p>
<p>A Tracker module can only be played while all other AMOS Professional music is stopped. The </p>
<p>following TRACKER instructions should only be used for Tracker modules and not for normal AMOS </p>
<p>Professional music, otherwise some bizarre noises are likely to be generated. The AMOS Professional </p>
<p>VOLUME and TEMPO commands will have no effect on Tracker modules, which have their own </p>
<p>built-in controls.</p>
<p><b>TRACK LOAD</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: load a Tracker module</i></p>
<p>Track Load “modulename”,bank number</p>
<p>Use this command to load a specified Tracker module into the memory bank number of your choice. </p>
<p>Any existing data in this bank will be erased before the module is loaded, and the new bank will be  </p>
<p>called “Tracker”.</p>
<p><b>TRACK PLAY</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: play a Tracker module</i></p>

<p>Playing Music Modules</p>
<p>To start your Tracker module playing, give this command followed by the appropriate bank number. </p>
<p>If the bank number is omitted, bank number 6 will be used as a default.</p>
<p>Most electronic composers use sets of patterns to make up a tune, and these can be repeated in any </p>
<p>suitable order. A Tracker sequence can be started from any one of these patterns, providing that you </p>
<p>know which pattern number refers to which particular part of the sequence. An optional pattern </p>
<p>number can be added after the bank number parameter. Here are some example settings:</p>
<p>Track Play : Rem Use default Tracker bank</p>
<p>Track Play ,5 : Rem Play pattern 5 from default Tracker bank</p>
<p>Track Play 9,5: Rem Play pattern 5 from bank 9</p>
<p><b>TRACK LOOP ON</b></p>
<p><b>TRACK LOOP OFF</b></p>
<p><i>instructions: toggle a Tracker loop</i></p>
<p><b>Track Loop On</b></p>
<p><b>Track Loop Off</b></p>
<p>Use these commands to make Tracker modules loop over and over again, or to stop a particular loop </p>
<p>after it has commenced. Try this example:</p>
<p>Track Load “AMOSPro_Examples:Music/Mod.Tracker”</p>
<p>Track Play</p>
<p>Track Loop On</p>
<p><b>TRACK STOP</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: stop all Tracker music</i></p>
<p><b>Track Stop</b></p>
<p>This command is used to halt all Tracker modules playing.</p>
<p><b>Playing Med modules</b></p>
<p>If   you   wish   to   play   Med  modules,   the   “Medplayer.library”  file   must   be   in   your   “Libs:”  folder. </p>
<p>Naturally, if you have no intention of exploiting the Med library, there is no need to load it and  </p>
<p>allocate unnecessary memory. Both “MMDO” and “MMD1” modules can be used for your programs.</p>
<p><b>MED LOAD</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: load a Med module</i></p>
<p><b>Med Load</b> “Module name”,bank number</p>
<p>The MED LOAD instruction loads the specified module in memory, and re-locates it to the specified </p>
<p>reserved bank in Chip memory. This bank is not a data bank, and will not be saved along with your  </p>
<p>program, so Med modules must be loaded anew each time that the program is run.</p>
<p>This command will open the “Medplayer.library” file, and you may be asked to insert your System </p>
<p>disc into the drive if this file is not available on the current disc.</p>

<p>Playing Music Modules</p>
<p>As with Tracker modules, AMOS Professional sound samples can be played while Med modules are </p>
<p>active. When a sound effect is triggered, any Med music will be stopped on all four voices, and will </p>
<p>start again as soon as the sample has been played.</p>
<p><b>MED PLAY</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: play a Med module</i></p>
<p><b>Med Play</b></p>
<p><b>Med Play</b> <i>bank number</i>,song number</p>
<p>This instruction plays the specified currently loaded Med module. If no bank number parameter is </p>
<p>given, the data in the last appropriate bank to be loaded will be played. Med modules can include </p>
<p>more than one song, and an individual melody can be specified by including the song number to be </p>
<p>played, as follows:</p>
<p>Med Play 2</p>
<p>Med Play ,2</p>
<p>Med Play 2,2</p>
<p><b>MED STOP</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: stop the current Med module</i></p>
<p><b>Med Stop</b></p>
<p>This simple instruction halts the current Med song being played. The song can now be started from </p>
<p>the beginning with a new call to MED PLAY, or continued using a MED CONT command.</p>
<p><b>MED CONT</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: continue a Med module</i></p>
<p><b>Med Cont</b></p>
<p>This   command   is   used   to   re-commence   a   Med   module   that   has   been   halted   by   a   MED   STOP </p>
<p>instruction. The song will continue from the exact point at which it was stopped.</p>
<p><b>MED MIDI ON</b></p>
<p><i>instruction: access MIDI instructions in a Med module</i></p>
<p><b>Med Midi On</b></p>
<p>MIDI is the international standard by which musical instruments talk to one another and stands for </p>
<p>Musical Instrument Digital Interface. If the Med module contains MIDI instructions for controlling </p>
<p>keyboards, drum machines and so on, the MED MIDI ON command must be given <b>before</b> the first </p>
<p>MED LOAD command, in other words, before the “Medplayer.library” file is opened.</p>
